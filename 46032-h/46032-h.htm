<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION_TO_AMERICAN_EDITION" id="INTRODUCTION_TO_AMERICAN_EDITION">INTRODUCTION TO AMERICAN EDITION.</a></h2>


<p>A biography of the great Bering is of especial interest to
American readers desiring an accurate history of a country
that has recently come into our possession, and the adjoining
regions where most of the geographical investigations of the
intrepid Danish-Russian explorer were made. The thorough, concise,
and patient work done by Mr. Lauridsen is deserving of
world-wide commendation, while the translation into the language
of our land by Professor Olson of the University of Wisconsin puts
students of American historical geography under a debt for this
labor of love rather than remuneration that cannot be easily paid,
and which is not common in our country. It is a matter of no
small national pride that the translation into the English language
of a work so near American geographical interests should have
been done by an American, rather than emanate from the Hakluyt
Society or other British sources, from which we usually derive
such valuable translations and compilations of old explorations and
the doings of the first explorers.</p>

<p>The general American opinion regarding Bering is probably
somewhat different from that on the continent which gave him
birth and a patron government to carry out his gigantic and
immortal plans; or, better speaking, it was different during the
controversy in the past over the value and authenticity of the
great explorer's works, for European opinion of Bering has slowly
been more and more favorable to him, until it has reached the
maximum and complete vindication in the admirable labors of
Lauridsen, whose painstaking researches in the only archives
where authentic data of the doings of the daring Dane could be
found, has left no ground for those critics to stand upon, who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
censured Peter the Great's selection of an oriental explorer. In
short, America has always respected Bering as a great explorer,
and oftentimes heralded him as one of the highest of heroes, whatever
may have been the varying phases of European thought on the
subject; and the reasons therefor, I think, are two-fold. In the
first place, the continent which Bering first separated from the
old world is yet a new country. Since its discovery, not only
exploration, but commercial exploration, or pioneering as we call
it, has been going on, and in this every one has taken his part or
mingled often with those who have. Presidents who were
pioneers, have been contemporaries with our times, while those who
have struggled on the selvage of civilization are numerous among
us, and their adventures as narrated in books are familiar stories
to our ears. Such a people, I believe, am much less liable to
listen to the labored logic of a critic against a man who carried his
expedition six thousand miles across a wilderness and launched
it on the inhospitable shores of an unknown sea, to solve a problem
that has borne them fruit, than others not similarly situated would
be. While the invariable rule has been that where the path-finder
and critic&mdash;unless the critic has been an explorer in the same field&mdash;have
come in collision, the latter has always gone to the wall, it is
easy to see that with a jury that have themselves lived amidst
similar, though possibly slighter, frontier fortunes, such a verdict is
more readily reached.</p>

<p>The other reason, which is not so commendable, is that few
Americans at large have interested themselves in the discussion,
or in fact knew much about it. True, the criticisms on the Eastern
continent have been re-echoed on this side of the water, and even
added to, but, they have created no general impression worth
recording as such in a book that will undoubtedly have far wider
circulation than the discussion has ever had, unless I have misjudged
the temper of the American people to desire information
on just such work as Bering has done, and which for the first
time is presented to them in anything like an authentic way by
Professor Olson's translation of Mr. Lauridsen's work. I do not
wish to be understood that we as a nation have been wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
indifferent to Bering and the discussion of his claims. Far from it.
It has rather been that in invading the Bering world their disposition
has led them to view the solid ground on which he made his
mark, rather than the clouds hovering above, and which this work
dissipates. It is rather of that character of ignorance&mdash;if so strong
a word is justifiable&mdash;that is found here in the persistent misspelling
of the great explorer's name and the bodies of water which have
transmitted it to posterity so well, although the authority&mdash;really
the absolute demand, if correctness is desired&mdash;for the change
from <i>Behring</i> to <i>Bering</i> has been well known to exist for a number
of years, and is now adopted in even our best elementary geographies.
While the animalish axiom that "ignorance is bliss" is
probably never true, there may be cases where it is apparently
fortunate, and this may be so in that Americans in being seemingly
apathetic have really escaped a discussion which after all has
ended in placing the man considered in about the same <i>status</i> that
they always assumed he had filled. One might argue that it would
have been better for Americans, therefore, if they had been presented
with a simple and authentic biography of the immortal
Danish-Russian, rather than with a book that is both a biography
and a defense, but Lauridsen's work after all is the best, I think all
will agree, as no biography of Bering could be complete without
some account of that part in which he had no making and no
share, as well as that better part which he chronicled with his
own brain and brawn.</p>

<p>I doubt yet if Americans will take very much interest in the
dispute over Bering's simple claims in which he could take no
part; but that this book, which settles them so clearly, will be
welcomed by the reading classes of a nation that by acquisition in
Alaska has brought them so near the field of the labor of Bering,
I think there need not be the slightest fear. It is one of the most
important links yet welded by the wisdom of man which can be
made into a chain of history for our new acquisition whose history
is yet so imperfect, and will remain so, until Russian archives are
placed in the hands of those they consider fair-minded judges,
as in the present work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<p>On still broader grounds, it is to be hoped that this work will
meet with American success, that it may be an entering wedge to
that valuable literature of geographical research and exploration,
which from incompatibility of language and other causes has never
been fully or even comprehensively opened to English speaking
people. It has been well said by one who has opportunities to
fairly judge that "it has been known by scientists for some time
that more valuable investigation was buried from sight in the
Russian language than in any or all others. Few can imagine
what activity in geographical, statistical, astronomical, and other
research has gone on in the empire of the Czar. It is predicted
that within ten years more students will take up the Russian
language than those of other nations of Eastern Europe, simply as
a necessity. This youngest family of the Aryans is moving westward
with its ideas and literature, as well as its population and
empire. There are no better explorers and no better recorders
of investigations." It is undoubtedly a field in which Americans
can reap a rich reward of geographical investigation. There is
an idea among some, and even friends of Russia, that their travelers
and explorers have not done themselves justice in recording
their doings, but this in the broad sense is not true. Rather they
have been poor chroniclers for the public; but their official reports,
hidden away in government archives, are rich in their thorough
investigations, oftentimes more nearly perfect and complete than
the equivalents in our own language, where it takes no long argument
to prove that great attention given to the public and popular
account, has been at the expense of the similar qualities in the
official report; while many expeditions, American and British, have
not been under official patronage at all, which has seldom been the
case with Russian research. As already noted, the bulk of similar
volumes from other languages and other archives into the English
has come from Great Britain; but probably from the unfortunate
bitter antagonism between the two countries which has created
an apathy in one and a suspicion in the other that they will not
be judged in an unprejudiced way, Russia has not got a fair share
of what she has really accomplished geographically translated into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
our tongue. It is through America, an unprejudiced nation, that
this could be remedied, if a proper interest is shown, and which
will probably be determined, in a greater or less degree, by the
reception of this book here, although it comes to us in the roundabout
way of the Danish language.</p>

<h2><a name="TRANSLATORS_PREFACE" id="TRANSLATORS_PREFACE">TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>In placing before the American public this book on Vitus Bering,
I desire to express my cordial thanks to those who by word
and deed have assisted me. I am especially grateful to Lieutenant
Frederick Schwatka, who, in the midst of pressing literary labors
consequent on his recent explorations among the cave and cliff
dwellers of the Sierra Madre Mountains, has been so exceedingly
kind as to write an introduction to the American edition of this
work. I feel confident that the introductory words of this doughty
explorer will secure for Bering that consideration from the American
people to which he is fairly entitled.</p>

<p>I find it a pleasant day to acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr.
Leonhard Stejneger of the Smithsonian Institution, who has sent
me some valuable and interesting notes to the chapter on "The
Stay on Bering Island" (Chapter XIX). Dr. Stejneger's notes are
of especial interest, for in the years 1882-'84 he spent eighteen
months on Bering Island in the service of the United States government,
the object of his expedition being to study the general
natural history of the island, to collect specimens of all kinds,
but especially to search for remains of the sea-cow. He wished
also to identify the places mentioned by Steller, the famous naturalist
of the Bering expedition, in order to compare his description
with the localities as they present themselves to-day, and to visit
the places where Bering's vessel was wrecked, where the ill-fated
expedition wintered, and where Steller made his observations on
the sea-cow. The results of Dr. Stejneger's investigations have
been published in "Proceedings of the United States National
Museum" and in various American and European scientific
journals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>I am also under obligation to Prof. Rasmus B. Anderson,
Ex-United States Minister to Denmark, through whom I have
been enabled to make this an authorized edition, and to Reuben G.
Thwaites, Secretary of the Wisconsin State Historical Society, and
Frederick J. Turner, Assistant Professor of American History in
the University of Wisconsin, for valuable criticism and suggestions.</p>

<p>In regard to the orthography of Russian and Siberian names, I
wish to say that I have endeavored to follow American writers that
advocate a rational simplification. W. H. Dall, author of "Alaska
and its Resources," says on this point: "From ignorance of the
true phonetic value of the Russian compound consonants, and
from literal transcription, instead of phonetic translation, of the
German rendering of Russian and native names, much confusion
has arisen. Many writers persistently represent the third
letter of the Russian alphabet by <i>w</i>, writing Romanow instead of
Romanoff, etc. The twenty-fifth letter is also frequently rendered
<i>tsch</i> instead of <i>ch</i> soft, as in church, which fully represents it in
English. It is as gross an error to spell <i>Kamchatka</i> for instance,
<i>Kamtschatka</i>, as it would be for a foreigner to represent the
English word <i>church</i> by <i>tschurtsch</i>, and so on." From this it
would seem that the Germanized forms of these names are incorrect,
as well as needlessly forbidding in appearance. It is, moreover,
due to German writers that Bering's name has been burdened
with a superfluous letter. Facsimiles of his autograph, one of
which may be seen by referring to Map I. in the Appendix, prove
incontestably that he spelled his name without an <i>h</i>.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Lauridsen's book is essentially a defense of Vitus
Bering, written especially for the student of history and historical
geography, it nevertheless contains several chapters of thrilling
interest to the general reader. The closing chapters, for instance,
give, not only a reliable account of the results of Bering's voyage of
discovery in the North Pacific, and valuable scientific information
concerning the remarkable animal life on Bering Island, where,
before Bering's frail ship was dashed upon its shores, no human
foot had trod, but they also portray in vivid colors the tragic events
that brought this greatest of geographical enterprises to a close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>The regions to which Bering's last labors gave Russia the first
title are at the present time the object of much newspaper comment.
His last expedition, the few survivors of which brought home
costly skins that evinced the great wealth of the newly discovered
lands, opened up to the Russian fur-hunter an El Dorado that
still continues to be a most profitable field of pursuit, now vigilantly
watched by the jealous eyes of rival nations.</p>

<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>Through the patronage of the Hielmstierne-Rosencrone Institution,
obtained in the summer of 1883, I was enabled to spend
some time among the archives and libraries in St. Petersburg, to
prepare myself for undertaking this work on Vitus Bering. I very
soon, however, encountered obstacles which unassisted I should not
have been able to surmount; for, contrary to my expectations, all
the original manuscripts and archives pertaining to the history of
Bering were written in Russian, and the latter in such difficult
language that none but native pal&aelig;ographers could read them.</p>

<p>I should for this reason have been compelled to return without
having accomplished anything, had I not in two gentlemen,
Admiral Th. Wessalgo and Mr. August Thornam of the telegraph
department, found all the assistance that I needed. The Admiral
is director of the department of hydrography, and has charge of
the magnificent archives of the Admiralty. He is very familiar
with the history of the Russian fleet, and he gave me, not only
excellent and exhaustive bibliographical information, besides putting
at my disposal the library of the department, but also had
made for me copies of various things that were not easily accessible.
He has, moreover, since my return been unwearied in furnishing me
such information from the Russian archives as I have desired. For
all of this kindness, enhanced by the Admiral's flattering remarks
about Denmark and the Danes, I find it a pleasant duty to express
my warmest thanks. To Mr. Thornam I am no less indebted.
Notwithstanding his laborious duties in the central telegraph office
of St. Petersburg, he found it possible week after week, often
eight or ten hours out of the twenty-four, to assist me in translating
the vast materials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides this, I derived much benefit from his comprehensive
knowledge of Siberia, obtained on travels in the same regions where
Bering had been. He has had the kindness to examine the collection
of charts and maps in both the Admiralty and Imperial
libraries, and secure for me some valuable copies. He has also, at
my request, examined a series of articles in periodicals containing
notices of Bering's geographical enterprise.</p>

<p>It is only by means of this valuable assistance that I have succeeded
in basing this biographical sketch on Russian literature, and
putting it, as I hope, on a par with what has been written on this
subject by Russian authors.</p>

<p>Of the many others that in one way or another have seconded
my efforts in giving as valuable a biography of my renowned fellow-countryman
as possible, I owe special thanks&mdash;not to mention the
Hielmstierne-Rosencrone Institution&mdash;to Mr. Hegel, the veteran
publisher, Col. Hoskier, Dr. Karl Verner, instructor in Sclavonic
languages at the University of Copenhagen, who has examined some
very difficult archival matter for me, Professor Alexander Vasilievich
Grigorieff, Secretary of the Imperial Russian Geographical
Society, and to Mr. E. W. Dahlgren, Secretary of the Swedish
Society for Anthropology and Geography. P. L.</p>

RUSSIA AND ENGLAND IN THE WORK OF ARCTIC EXPLORATION.&mdash;VITUS
BERING'S RANK AS AN EXPLORER.</h3>


<p>In the great work of Arctic exploration done during
the last two centuries, it was first Russia and later
England that took the lead, and to these two nations we
are principally indebted for our knowledge of Arctic continental
coast-lines. The English expeditions were undertaken
with better support, and under circumstances better
designed to attract public attention. They have, moreover,
been excellently described, and are consequently well
known. But in the greatness of the tasks undertaken, in
the perseverance of their leaders, in difficulties, dangers,
and tragic fates, Russian explorations stand worthily at
their side. The geographical position of the Russians,
their dispersion throughout the coldest regions of the
earth, their frugal habits, remarkable power of foresight,
and their adventurous spirit, make them especially fitted
for Arctic explorations. Hence, as early as the first half
of the eighteenth century, they accomplished for Asia what
the English not until a hundred years later succeeded in
doing for the other side of the earth,&mdash;namely, the
charting of the polar coasts.</p>

<p>In this work the Russians introduced the system of
coasting and sledging into the service of Arctic expeditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and it is only through a systematic development of
these means that western Europe has been enabled to
celebrate its most brilliant triumphs in the Arctic regions,
and to succeed in getting farther than did the navigators
of the seventeenth century. The history of Russian polar
explorations has a series of proud names, which lack only
the pen of a Sherard Osborn to shine by the side of
Franklin and McClure, and it redounds to the honor of
Denmark that one of the first and greatest of these men
was a Dane,&mdash;that the most brilliant chapter in the history
of Russian explorations is due to the initiative and
indefatigable energy of Vitus Bering. In the service of
Peter the Great he successfully doubled the northeastern
peninsula of Asia, and after his return he made a plan for
the exploration of the whole Northeast passage from the
White Sea to Japan. Although he succumbed in this
undertaking, he lived long enough to see his gigantic
plans approach realization.</p>

<p>Bering was buried on an island in the Pacific, amid the
scenes of his labors, under that sand-barrow which had
been his death-bed. For many generations only a plain
wooden cross marked his resting-place, and as for his
fame, it has been as humble and modest as his head-board.
His labors belonged to a strange people who had but little
sympathy for the man. His own countrymen, among
whom he might have found this sympathetic interest,
knew his work but very imperfectly. Not until after the
lapse of a century did he find a careful biographer, and
even within comparatively recent years the great scientist
Von Baer has found it necessary to defend him against
misunderstandings and petty attacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Danish literature contains nothing of moment concerning
him, for the two treatises which several generations
ago were published by M. Hallager and Odin Wolff, are
merely scanty extracts from G. F. M&uuml;ller's historical
works. In the following pages, therefore, relying not
only upon Russian, but also upon West European literature
for information, we desire to erect to him a monument
by giving a short account of his life and work, sketching
at the same time a chapter of geographical history which
is lacking neither in importance nor in interest.</p>

BERING'S NATIVITY.&mdash;NORWEGIANS AND DANES IN THE
SERVICE OF PETER THE GREAT.&mdash;FOUNDING OF THE
RUSSIAN NAVY.</h3>


<p>Vitus Bering was a son of Jonas Svendsen and
his second wife, Anna Bering of Horsens, at which
place he was born in the summer of 1681. On the maternal
side he descended from the distinguished Bering
family, which during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries flourished in various parts of Denmark, and included
a very respectable number of ministers and judicial
officers.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Our hero passed his childhood in a Christian family of
culture in the Jutland seaport town of his birth. Here
for a series of years his father filled several positions of
trust, and was closely associated with the leading men of
the place, as his wife's sister, Margaret Bering, had married
two consecutive mayors. He was, however, far from
being considered well-to-do. He had many children.
One of his sons had caused him much trouble and expense,
and was finally sent to the East Indies. In the
probate record of his estate, made in 1719, there is a deed
of conveyance from himself and wife in which the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>appears: "We are old, miserable, and decrepit people, in
no way able to help ourselves. Our property consists of
the old dilapidated home and the furniture thereto belonging,
which is of but little value." It was his share
of this inheritance, with accrued interest, all amounting
to 140 <i>rigsdaler</i>, that Vitus Bering later presented
to his native town to be used for the benefit of the
poor.</p>

<p>From inclination, and forced by the circumstances of
his humble home, Bering went to sea, and on the long
expeditions that he made, he developed into an able seaman.
From an East India expedition in 1703 he came to
Amsterdam, where he made the acquaintance of Admiral
Cruys, a native of Norway. Soon afterwards, at the age
of twenty-two, he joined a Russian fleet as a sub-lieutenant.
What Norwegian and Danish seamen accomplished
at this period in the service of Russia, has been almost
entirely forgotten. In the company of intelligent foreigners
that Czar Peter employed for the transformation
of his kingdom, the Danish-Norse contingent occupies a
prominent place. This is due principally to Peter himself,
and was a result of his experiences in Holland.
After having, on his first extensive foreign trip, learned
the art of ship-building,&mdash;not in Zaandam, as it is usually
stated, but at the docks of the East India Company in
Amsterdam,&mdash;he was much dissatisfied with the empirical
method which the Hollanders used, and he wrote to
Voronetz, his own ship-yard, that the Dutch ship-builders
there should no longer be permitted to work independently,
but be placed under the supervision of Danes or
Englishmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter retained his high regard for Danish-Norse ship-building
during his whole life, and it was on this
account that Danes and Norwegians were enabled to
exert so great an influence in St. Petersburg. This is
the reason, too, that Danish-Norse<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> seamen were received
so kindly in Russia even long after the death of the great
Czar.</p>

<p>Next to Peter, Norwegians and Danes had the greatest
share in the founding of the Russian fleet, and among
them the place of honor belongs to the Norseman Cornelius
Cruys, who in 1697 was assistant master of ordnance
in the Dutch navy, where he was held in high regard as a
ship-builder, a cartographer, and as a man well versed in
everything pertaining to the equipment of a fleet. Peter
made him his vice-admiral, and assigned to him the technical
control of the fleet, the building of new vessels,
their equipment, and, above all, the task of supplying
them with West European officers.</p>

<p>Weber assigns Cruys a place in the first rank among
those foreigners to whom Russia owes much of her development,
and remarks that it was he, "the incomparable
master of ordnance, who put the Russian fleet upon its
keel and upon the sea." He belonged to the fashionable
circles of St. Petersburg, owned a large and beautiful
palace on the Neva, where now tower the Winter Palace
and the Hermitage, and was one of the few among the
wealthy that enjoyed the privilege of entertaining the
Czar on festive occasions. He became vice-president of
the council of the Admiralty, was promoted, after the
peace of Nystad, to the position of admiral of the Blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>Flag, and made a knight of the order of Alexander
Nevsky.</p>

<p>In Peter the Great's remarkable house in St. Petersburg
there is preserved, among many other relics, a yawl
which is called the grandfather of the fleet. With this,
Peter had begun his nautical experiments, and in 1723,
when he celebrated the founding of his fleet, he rowed
down the Neva in it. Peter himself was at the rudder,
Apraxin was cockswain, and Admiral Cruys, Vice-Admiral
Gordon, Sievers and Menshikoff were at the
oars. On this occasion the Czar embraced Cruys and
called him his father.</p>

<p>During his whole life Cruys preserved a warm affection
for his native land; hence it was natural that the
Scandinavian colony in St. Petersburg gathered about
him. His successor as vice-president of the council of
the Admiralty, and as master of ordnance, was the former
Danish naval lieutenant Peter Sievers, who likewise elevated
himself to most important positions, and exerted a
highly beneficial influence upon the development of the
Russian fleet. At the side of these two heroes, moreover,
there were others, as Admirals Daniel Wilster and Peter
Bredal, Commander Thure Trane, and also Skeving,
Herzenberg, Peder Grib, "Tordenskjold's<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> brave comrade
in arms," and many others.</p>

<p>For a long time Vitus Bering was one of Cruys's most
intimate associates, and these two, with Admiral Sievers,
form an honorable trio in that foreign navy. Bering was
soon appointed to a position in the Baltic fleet, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>during Russia's protracted struggles, his energy found
that scope which he before had sought on the ocean, and
at the same time he had the satisfaction of fighting the
foes of his native land. He was a bold and able commander.
During the whole war he cruised about in the
Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, and in the Baltic and
other northern waters. Some of the most important
transport expeditions were entrusted to him. The Czar
prized his services very highly, and when, after the misfortune
at Pruth in 1711, he laid a plan to rescue three
of the best ships of his Black Sea fleet by a bold run
through the Bosporus, Vitus Bering, Peder Bredal, and
Simon Skop were chosen for the task. Whether the plan
was carried out, it is difficult to determine. Berch says
that it was not, and adds, "I cite the incident simply to
show that even at that time Bering was looked upon as
an excellent commander." In various West European
authorities, however, it is distinctly stated that Sievers
conducted the ships to England, and in a review of
Bering's life published by the Admiralty in 1882, it is
stated that Bering was in 1711 appointed to conduct the
ship Munker from the Sea of Azov to the Baltic, and as
the Admiralty would hardly in a condensed report have
taken notice of plans which had never been carried out,
it seems most probable that Berch has been incorrectly
informed.</p>

<p>In 1707 Bering was promoted to the position of lieutenant,
in 1710 to that of lieutenant-captain, and in 1715
to that of captain of the fourth rank, when he assumed
command of the new ship Selafail in Archangel to sail it
to Copenhagen and Kronstadt. In 1716 he participated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in an expedition of the united fleets to Bornholm under
the command of Sievers. In 1717 he was made captain
of the third, and in 1720 of the second rank, and took
part, until peace was concluded, in the various man&oelig;uvers
in the Baltic under the command of Gordon and
Apraxin.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>After the peace of Nystad in 1721, however, his position
became somewhat unpleasant. Although he was a
brother-in-law of Vice-Admiral Saunders, he had, according
to Berch, powerful enemies in the Admiralty. The
numerous promotions made after the conclusion of peace,
in no way applied to him. In the following year younger
comrades were advanced beyond him, and hence in 1724
he demanded promotion to a captaincy of the first rank,
or his discharge. After protracted negotiations, and in
spite of the fact that Apraxin repeatedly refused to sign
his discharge, he finally obtained it, and then withdrew
to his home in Viborg, Finland, where he owned an
estate, and where, no doubt on account of the Scandinavian
character of the city, he preferred to stay. During
the negotiations for his discharge, the Czar was in
Olonetz, but some time afterwards he informed Apraxin
that Bering was again to enter the navy, and with the
desired promotion. This occurred in August, 1724, and
a few months later Bering was appointed chief of the
<i>First Kamchatkan Expedition</i>, the object of which was
to determine whether Asia and America were connected
by land.</p>

PLANS FOR BERING'S FIRST EXPEDITION.&mdash;PETER THE
GREAT'S DESIRE TO KNOW THE EXTENT OF HIS EMPIRE.&mdash;THE
NORTHEAST PASSAGE.</h3>


<p>The equipment of Bering's first expedition was one of
Peter the Great's last administrative acts. From his
death-bed his energy set in motion those forces which in
the generation succeeding him were to conquer a new
world for human knowledge. It was not until his mighty
spirit was about to depart this world that the work was
begun, but the impetus given by him was destined to be
effective for half a century; and the results achieved still
excite our admiration.</p>

<p>Peter was incited to undertake this work by a desire
for booty, by a keen, somewhat barbaric curiosity, and by
a just desire to know the natural boundaries of his
dominion. He was no doubt less influenced by the flattery
of the French Academy and other institutions than
is generally supposed. His great enterprise suddenly
brought Russia into the front rank of those nations which
at that time were doing geographical exploration. Just
before his death three great enterprises were planned:
the establishment of a mart at the mouth of the river
Kur for the oriental trade, the building up of a maritime
trade with India, and an expedition to search for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the boundary between Asia and America. The first
two projects did not survive the Czar, but Bering
clung to the plan proposed for him, and accomplished
his task.</p>

<p>Peter the Great gave no heed to obstacles, and never
weighed the possibilities for the success of an enterprise.
Consequently his plans were on a grand scale, but the
means set aside for carrying them out were often entirely
inadequate, and sometimes even wholly inapplicable. His
instructions were usually imperious and laconic. To his
commander-in-chief in Astrakhan he once wrote: "When
fifteen boats arrive from Kazan, you will sail them to
Baku and sack the town." His instructions to Bering are
characteristic of his condensed and irregular style. They
were written by himself, in December, 1724, five weeks
before his death, and are substantially as follows: "I. At
Kamchatka or somewhere else two decked boats are to be
built. II. With these you are to sail northward along the
coast, and as the end of the coast is not known this land
is undoubtedly America. III. For this reason you are
to inquire where the American coast begins, and go to
some European colony; and when European ships are seen
you are to ask what the coast is called, note it down, make
a landing, obtain reliable information, and then, after
having charted the coast, return."</p>

<p>After West Europe for two centuries had wearied itself
with the question of a Northeast passage and made strenuous
efforts to navigate the famed Strait of Anian, Russia
undertook the task in a practical manner and went in
search of the strait, before it started out on a voyage
around the northern part of the old world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Were Asia and America connected, or was there a
strait between the two countries? Was there a Northwest
and a Northeast passage? It was these great and
interesting questions that were to be settled by Bering's
first expedition. Peter himself had no faith in a strait.
He had, however, no means of knowing anything about
it, for at his death the east coast of Asia was known only
as far as the island of Yezo. The Pacific coast of America
had been explored and charted no farther than Cape
Blanco, 43&deg; north latitude, while all of the northern portion
of the Pacific, its eastern and western coast-lines, its
northern termination, and its relation to the polar sea,
still awaited its discoverer.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned ukase shows that the Czar's
inquisitive mind was dwelling on the possibility of being
able, through northeastern Asia, to open a way to the rich
European colonies in Central America. He knew neither
the enormous extent of the far East nor the vastness of
the ocean that separated it from the Spanish colonies.
Yet even at that time, various representatives of the great
empire living in northeastern Siberia had some knowledge
of the relative situation of the two continents and could
have given Bering's expedition valuable directions.</p>

<p>Rumors of the proximity of the American continent to
the northeastern corner of Asia must very early have been
transmitted through Siberia, for the geographers of the
sixteenth century have the relative position of the two
continents approximately correct. Thus on the Barents
map of 1598, republished by J. J. Pontanus in 1611, a
large continent towers above northeastern Asia with
the superscription, "America Pars," the two countries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
being separated by the Strait of Anian<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> (Fretum Anian).
On a map by Joducus Hondius, who died in 1611, East
Siberia is drawn as a parallelogram projecting toward the
northeast, and directly opposite and quite near the northeast
corner of this figure a country is represented with the
same superscription. This is found again in the map by
Gerhard Mercator which accompanies Nicolai Witsen's
"<i>Noord en Ost Tartarye</i>," 1705, and in several other
sixteenth century atlases. It is quite impossible to determine
how much of this apparent knowledge is due to
vague reports combined with happy guessing, and how
much to a practical desire for such a passage on the part
of European navigators, whose expensive polar expeditions
otherwise would be folly. This much is certain, however:
Witsen and other leading geographers based their views
on information received from Siberia and Russia.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In the history of discoveries the spirit of human enterprise
has fought its way through an incalculable number
of mirages. These have aroused the imagination, caused
agitations, debates, and discussions, but have usually
veiled an earlier period's knowledge of the question.
There are many re-discovered countries on our globe. So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>in this case. The northwestern part of America wholly
disappeared from the cartography of the seventeenth century,
and through the influence of Witsen's and Homann's
later maps it became customary to represent the eastern
coast of Asia by a meridian passing a little east of Yakutsk,
without any suggestions whatever in regard to its strongly
marked peninsulas or to an adjacent western continent.
But even these representations were originally Russian,
and are undoubtedly due to the first original Russian
atlas, published by Remesoff. They finally gave way to
the geographical explorations of the eighteenth century,
which began shortly after the accession of Peter the
Great, having been provoked by political events and
conditions.</p>

<p>By the treaty of Nertchinsk in 1689 the Yablonoi
Mountains were established as the boundary line between
Russia and China. By this means the way to the fertile
lands of Amoor was barred to that indurate caste of
Russian hussars and Cossacks who had conquered for the
White Czar the vast tracts of Siberia. A second time
they fell upon northeastern Siberia, pressing their way, as
before, across uninhabited tundras along the northern
ocean, and thence conquered the inhabited districts
toward the south. They discovered the island of Liakhov,
penetrated the country of the Chukchees, Koriaks,
and Kamshadales, and at the Anadyr River, in Deshneff's
old palisaded fort, they found that point of support from
which they maintained Russia's power in the extreme
northeast. In this way the Russians learned the enormous
extent of the country; but as they had no exact locations,
they formed a very incorrect opinion of its outlines, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
estimated its length from west to east too small by forty
degrees.</p>

<p>From the fort on the Anadyr, Kamchatka was conquered
in the first years of the eighteenth century, and
from here came the first information concerning America.
In 1711 the Cossack Popoff visited the Chukchee peninsula,
and here he heard that from either side of the
peninsula, both from the "Kolymaic" Sea and the Gulf
of Anadyr, an island could be seen in the distance, which
the Chukchees called "the great land." This land they
said they could reach in <i>baidars</i> (boats rowed by women)
in one day. Here were found large forests of pine,
cedar, and other trees, and also many different kinds of
animals not found in their country. This reliable information
concerning America seems at the time to have
been known in other parts of Siberia only in the way of
vague reports, and was soon confused with descriptions of
islands in the Arctic.</p>

<p>Czar Peter, however, soon laid his adjusting hand
upon these groping efforts. By the aid of Swedish prisoners
of war, he opened the navigation from Okhotsk to
Kamchatka, and thus avoided the circuitous route by way
of the Anadyr. A Cossack by the name of Ivan Kosyrefski
(the son of a Polish officer in Russian captivity) was
ordered to explore the peninsula to its southern extremity,
and also some of the Kurile Islands. In 1719
he officially despatched the surveyors Yevrinoff and
Lushin to ascertain whether Asia and America were connected,
but secretly he instructed them to go to the
Kurile Islands to search for precious metals, especially a
white mineral which the Japanese were said to obtain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
large quantities from the fifth or sixth island. Through
these various expeditions there was collected vast, although
unscientific, materials for the more correct understanding
of the geography of eastern Asia, the Sea of
Okhotsk, Kamchatka, the Kuriles, and Yezo. Even concerning
the Island of Nipon (Hondo), shipwrecked Japanese
had given valuable information. Simultaneously,
the northern coast about the mouth of the Kolyma, had
been explored by the Cossacks Viligin and Amossoff.
Through them the first information concerning the Bear
Islands and Wrangell Island found its way to Yakutsk.
The Cossack chief Shestakoff, who had traveled into the
northeastern regions toward the land of the Chukchees,
accepted the accounts of the former for his map, but as
he could neither read nor write, matters were most bewilderingly
confused. Yet his representations were later
accepted by Strahlenberg and Joseph de l'Isle in their
maps.</p>

BERING'S KNOWLEDGE OF SIBERIAN GEOGRAPHY.&mdash;TERRORS
OF TRAVELING IN SIBERIA.&mdash;THE EXPEDITION
STARTS OUT.&mdash;THE JOURNEY FROM ST. PETERSBURG
TO THE PACIFIC.</h3>


<p>And now the question is, what did Bering know of
these efforts which had been made during the
decades preceding his expedition, and which in spite of
their unscientific character, were nevertheless of such
great importance in order to be able to initiate one's self
in the geography of eastern Asia? In the first place, the
surveyor Lushin, was a member of the Bering expedition,
and when Bering, in the summer of 1726, was sojourning
in Yakutsk, Shestakoff's nephew, who had accompanied
his uncle on his expedition against the Chukchees, became
an attach&eacute; of Bering's expedition, while the elder
Shestakoff had gone to Russia to collect means for the
contemplated military expedition. Furthermore, Ivan
Kosyrefski, who in the meantime had become a monk,
was also staying in Yakutsk, and his valuable report preserved
in the voivode's (governor's) office was now surrendered
to Bering. Thus we see that Bering was in
personal contact with the men, who, in the decade preceding,
were the chief possessors of geographical knowledge
concerning those northeastern regions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>In the second place, he received in Yakutsk information
concerning Deshneff's journey in 1648 from the
Kolyma to the Anadyr River. Although this journey
was first critically discussed by G. F. M&uuml;ller,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> its main
features were nevertheless well known in Siberia, and are
referred to, among other places, in Strahlenberg's book,
whence the results appear in Bellini's map in Peter
Charlesvoix's "<i>Histoire du Japan</i>," published in 1735.
Unfortunately, however, Bering seems to have had no
knowledge of Popoff's expedition to the Chukchees peninsula
and his information concerning the adjacent American
continent, or of Strahlenberg's outline maps, which
were not published until after his departure from St.
Petersburg.</p>

<p>Bering's two expeditions are unique in the history of
Arctic explorations. His real starting point was on the
extremest outskirts of the earth, where only the hunter
and yassak-collector had preceded him. Kamchatka
was at that time just as wild a region as Boothia or
the coasts of Smith's Sound are in our day, and,
practically viewed, it was far more distant from St.
Petersburg than any known point now is from us.
One hundred and thirty degrees&mdash;several thousand
miles&mdash;the earth's most inhospitable tracts, the coldest
regions on the globe, mountains, endless steppes, impenetrable
forests, morasses, and fields of trackless snow
were still between him and the mouth of the Kamchatka
River, and thither he was to lead, not a small
expedition, but an enormous provision train and large
quantities of material for ship-building. On the journey,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>river-boats had to be built by the score, and also two
ships. Now his course was up the swift streams of
Siberia, and now on horseback or in sledges drawn by
dogs through the dreary and desolate forests of the
Yakuts and Tunguses. He employed several hundred
laborers and twice as many horses to do work which
modern ships can accomplish in a few weeks. Franklin,
Mackenzie, Schwatka, and many others have traversed
vast tracts of the Arctic regions, but their expeditions
in light sledges can not be compared with those burdensome
transports which Bering and his men dragged
from the Gulf of Finland to the shores of the Pacific.</p>

<p>In the early part of the year 1725 the expedition
was ready to start out from St. Petersburg. The officers
were the two Danes, Vitus Bering, captain and
chief, and Martin Spangberg, lieutenant and second in
command, and also the following: Lieut. Alexei Chirikoff,
Second Lieut. Peter Chaplin, the cartographers
Luskin and Patiloff, the mates, Richard Engel and
George Morison, Dr. Niemann, and Rev. Ilarion.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The
subordinates were principally sailors, carpenters, sailmakers,
blacksmiths, and other mechanics.</p>

<p>Peter the Great died Jan. 28, 1725;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but a part
of the expedition under the command of Lieut. Chirikoff
had already started on the 24th; Bering followed
Feb. 5. They passed the whole of the first summer
in toilsome expeditions overland and on rivers in
western Siberia. March 16, they arrived at Tobolsk,
whence, in May, the journey was continued with four
rafts and seven boats by way of the rivers Irtish, Obi,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>Ket, Yenisei, Tunguska, and Ilim, through regions
where there was scarcely a Russian <i>isba</i>, on rivers which
were dangerous on account of hidden rocks and skerries,
and where progress was constantly interrupted by the
transporting that had to be done between the streams.
September 29, the expedition arrived at the town of
Ilimsk and had to pass the winter there. Meanwhile,
however, Lieut. Chaplin had, in the spring, been sent
in advance to Yakutsk, in order, at the voivode's (governor's)
to hasten the preparations for transportation in
the direction of Okhotsk, whither he was to send a
small command who were to fell trees and begin the
work of ship-building. Bering<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> himself went to Irkutsk
to obtain from the governor there information concerning
the climate and physical features of Eastern Siberia,
the modes of travel, and means of transportation in
that distant and little known country. Spangberg was
sent with mechanics and soldiers to the Kut, a tributary
of the Lena, for the purpose of cutting timber and
building vessels for the voyages to be made in the spring.
At Ustkutsk there were built in all fifteen barges
(about 45 feet long, 12 feet wide and 15 inches deep) and
fourteen boats. On May 8, 1726, Spangberg sailed for
Yakutsk, and somewhat later Chirikoff started off with
the rear. By the middle of June, the expedition was
gathered at the capital of East Siberia, which at that
time had three hundred houses. Here Bering remained
until the 16th of August, busily engaged in making
preparations for the difficult journey eastward. He
had made two thousand leathern sacks for transporting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>flour to Okhotsk, and gave the voivode orders to keep
in readiness six hundred horses to forward other necessaries
for the expedition.</p>

<p>From this point the expedition traveled an entirely
untrodden path, and the 1026 versts (685 miles) to
Okhotsk were a severe test of its endurance. Even in
our day, this journey can be made only under the greatest
difficulties. The region is rough and mountainous,
and intersected by deep streams without bridges or
other means of crossing. The traveler must traverse
dangerous swamps and tundras, or cut his way through
dense forests. In the winter the difficulties are doubled.
Horses, reindeer, and dogs soon become exhausted on
these unbroken roads. A space cleared in the snow,
when the cooking, eating, and sleeping are done, is the
only shelter. The temperature falls to -46&deg; R. (-71&deg;
Fahrenheit). Clothing must be changed daily to avoid
dampness, and when the <i>poorgas</i> (blizzards) sweep over
the snowy wastes, a few steps from camp are often
fatal. This is a description of that region in our day,
and it was hardly any more inviting over a hundred
and fifty years ago.</p>

<p>It was found necessary to divide the expedition.
The branching tributaries of the Lena offered possibilities
for transportation which had to be taken advantage
of. Hence, as early as July 7, Lieut. Spangberg
was sent by river with thirteen rafts loaded with materials,
and a force of 204 workmen to reach Yudomskaya
Krest by way of the tributaries Aldan, Maya, and
Yudoma, and thence across a ridge down to the river
Urak, which flows into the Sea of Okhotsk. The overland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
expeditions, consisting of 800 horses, were sent in
various directions. Bering himself started out on
August 16, with 200 horses, and after a journey of
forty-five days, reached Okhotsk. The journey was a
very difficult one. The horses sought in vain for food
under the deep snow. Scores of them were overcome
by hunger and exhaustion. The severe cold caused the
forces much suffering and hardship, nor did they find
but few comforts when they reached Okhotsk in the
latter part of October. The town consisted of only
eleven huts, with ten Russian families, who supported
themselves by fishing. Here, too, many of the horses
died for lack of food, and a herd of heifers sent there
by Shestakoff was lost from the same cause. Only
one survived the winter. It was now necessary to build
huts for the winter. The whole of November was spent
in felling trees, and not until December 2, could
Bering take shelter under a roof of his own. On the
other hand, the ship for the expedition was on the
stocks, and in spite of all troubles and privations,
Bering found time to push forward vigorously its
construction.</p>

<p>Spangberg, however, fared worst of all. Winter took
him by surprise two hundred and seventy-five miles
from Yudomskaya Krest, the nearest inhabited place,
in an entirely barren and swampy region where he could
not obtain the slightest assistance. His boats and the
bulk of their provisions had to be left at the confluence
of the Yorbovaya and the Yudoma, while he and his
men, with what provisions they could take with them
on the hand-sleds, started out for Okhotsk on foot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Meanwhile, the severity of the winter increased, the
mercury congealed, and the snow was soon six feet
deep. This forced them to leave their sleds, and for
eight full weeks after November 4, these travelers
sought shelter every night in the snows of Siberia,
wrapped in all the furs they could possibly get hold of.
Their provisions were soon exhausted, famine soon
became a companion to cold, and matters even came
to such a pass that they were compelled to try to
maintain life by gnawing "straps, leathern bags, and
shoes." They would surely have starved to death, had
they not accidentally happened to strike Bering's route,
where they found dead horses and a few hundred-weights
of flour. December 21, Bering received from Spangberg
a message, relating that he had started for Yudomskaya
Krest with ninety-six sledges, and that he had
left the boats in charge of a mate and six guards.
Bering immediately dispatched ten sledges with provisions
for his relief, and on the succeeding day, thirty-seven
sledges with thirty-nine men. January 6, 1727,
Spangberg reached Okhotsk, and a few days later his
whole command had arrived, eighteen of whom were
now sick. Twice during the course of the winter, Spangberg
and Chaplin were obliged to repeat this journey
to rescue the materials at the Yudoma. Not until
midsummer, 1727, did the rear under the command of
Chirikoff arrive from Yakutsk.</p>

<p>And yet Bering was far from the place where his
work of discovery could begin. On June 8, the new
ship Fortuna was launched and equipped for the
prospective voyage. Moreover, the ship that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
used in exploring the Sea of Okhotsk in 1716 arrived,
and after thorough repairs was put into the service.</p>

<p>Bering's next objective point was the mouth of the
river Bolshoya in southwestern Kamchatka. From the
mouth of this river, which is navigable for small vessels,
he took the Cossack route to the interior, first up
the Bolshoya to the tributary Byistraya, then up this
to within forty versts of its source, thence across a portage
to the Kamchatka, the mouth of which was his
real objective point. From this position he would be
able to fall back upon the Russian colony, which comprised
a number of unimportant stockaded forts on
the Bolshoya and Kamchatka rivers, and could
also gain support from that control of the natives
which was exercised from this point. This change of
base could have been much more easily and quickly
accomplished by sailing around the Kamchatka Peninsula,
but this was something that had never been done.
No accurate information was to be had in regard to the
waters, or to the location of any place. Possibly Bering
had not as yet been able to disabuse his mind of the
prevalent delusions concerning the great extent of Kamchatka.
In the second place, he was no doubt unwilling
to trust his invaluable stores in the inferior vessels
built at Okhotsk. Hence he took the old route.</p>

<p>July 1, Spangberg sailed with the Fortuna for
Bolsheretsk, accompanied by thirteen Siberian traders.
Two days later Chirikoff brought up the rear from
Yakutsk. Somewhat later, the quartermaster arrived
with 110 horses and 200 sacks of flour. A week later
63 horses more arrived, on July 20, one soldier with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
80 horses, and by the 30th over 150 horses more, and
also 50 oxen.</p>

<p>August 11, Spangberg returned from his voyage to
the Bolshoya River, and on the 19th the whole command
went on board,&mdash;some on the Fortuna and
others on the old vessel. Their destination was the
Bolshoya, situated 650 miles from Okhotsk, where they
arrived September 4. Here the cargoes were transferred
to boats and, in the course of the month of
September, brought to the fort, a simple log fortress
with seventeen Russian dwellings and a chapel, twenty
miles from the sea. It took the whole winter to traverse,
first with boats and later with sledges, the 585
miles across Kamchatka, from Bolsheretsk to the lower
Kamchatka fort. Under the greatest difficulties, the
expedition now followed the course of the Kamchatka
River, camping at night in the snow, and enduring
many a fierce struggle with the inclement weather.
The natives were summoned from far and near to assist
in transporting their goods, but the undertaking proved
fatal to many of them. Finally on March 11, 1728,
Bering reached his destination, the lower Kamchatka
Ostrog,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> where he found forty huts scattered along the
banks of the river, a fort, and a church. A handful
of Cossacks lived here. They occupied huts built above
the surface of the ground. They did not always eat
their fish raw, but in other respects lived like the
natives, and were in no regard much more civilized than
they. The fort was located twenty miles from the sea,
surrounded by forests of larch, which yielded excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>material for ship-building. From this point the exploring
party proper was to start out.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

THE BUILDING OF THE GABRIEL&mdash;THE DISCOVERY OF
BERING STRAIT.</h3>


<p>Bering now found himself upon the bleak shores of
an Arctic sea, with no other resources than those he
had brought with him, or could extort from these barren
tracts. He again began the work of ship-building, and
in the summer of 1728, a ship called the Gabriel, staunch
enough to weather a heavy sea, was launched. The
timber for this vessel had been hauled to the ship-yard by
dogs; the tar they had prepared themselves, while rigging,
cable, and anchors had been dragged nearly two
thousand miles through one of the most desolate regions
of the earth. And as for the provisions, they would certainly
strike terror in the hearts of Arctic explorers of
to-day. "Fish oil was his butter, and dried fish his beef
and pork. Salt he was obliged to get from the sea," and
according to the directions of the Cossacks he distilled
spirits from "sweet straw."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Thus supplied with a
year's provisions, he started upon his voyage of discovery
along an unknown coast and on an unknown sea. "It is
certain," says Dr. Campbell concerning Bering at this
stage, "that no person better fitted for this undertaking
could have been found; no difficulty, no danger daunted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>him. With untiring industry and almost incredible
patience he overcame those difficulties which to anyone
else would have seemed insurmountable."</p>

<p>On July 9, the Gabriel started down the river, and on
the 13th the sails were hoisted. The crew numbered forty-four
men: namely, one captain, two lieutenants, one second
lieutenant, one physician, one quartermaster, eight
sailors, one saddler, one rope-maker, five carpenters, one
bailiff, two Cossacks, nine soldiers, six servants, one
drummer, and two interpreters. Bering's point of
departure was the lower Kamchatka fort, situated 160&deg;
50' east of Greenwich, the variation of the compass being
13&deg; 10' E. The latitude of the cape at the mouth of the
Kamchatka River was determined as 56&deg; 3' N., which agrees
with the observations made by Cook, who was very near
this point on his last voyage. The day was reckoned from
12 o'clock at noon, on which account his dating does not
correspond with that of civil time; hence, the 16th of
August with him began on the 15th, at noon. The mile
of the journal is the Italian mile, which is somewhat
longer than the English mile. Bering's course was nearly
all the time along the coast, in from nine to twelve
fathoms of water, and usually with land in sight to the
north and west. On July 27, they passed Cape St.
Thaddeus at a distance of three miles, and here the
sea seemed fairly alive with spotted whales, seals, sea-lions,
and dolphins. After having sailed past the Anadyr
River, without quite being able to find their bearings in
regions of which they had not a single astronomical
determination, and where they were not successful in finding
any natives, they finally, on July 31, saw land extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
along the northern horizon, and soon afterwards
sailed into the Bay of the Holy Cross (St. Kresta Bay)
where the Gabriel spent two days under sail in search
of fresh water and a place to anchor. On the 2d of
August the latitude was determined as 60&deg; 50' N.,
whereupon the voyage was continued to the southeast
along the high and rocky coast, where every indentation
was very carefully explored. August 6, the Gabriel lay
in the Bay of Preobrashensky, and on the 7th, Chaplin
was sent ashore to obtain water from a mountain stream.
On his way he found huts, where there had quite recently
been Chukchees, and in various places he found footpaths,
but met no human beings. On the 8th, Bering sailed
along the coast in a south southeasterly direction. At 7
o'clock, a boat containing eight men was seen rowing
toward the vessel. They did not, however, dare to
approach the Gabriel, but at last one of the number
jumped into the water, and on two inflated seal bladders
swam out to the ship, and announced, by the aid of the
two Koriak interpreters, that they were Chukchees, and
that their people lived along the coast, that they knew
the Russians well, that the Anadyr River lay far to the
west, that the continent extended in the same direction,
and that they would soon get sight of an island. The
Koriaks, however, understood his language only imperfectly,
and the journal regrets that they were on this
account prevented from obtaining further important
information. Bering gave him some small presents and
sent him back to try to persuade his companions to come
on board. They approached the vessel, but suddenly
turned and disappeared. The latitude was 64&deg; 41'.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>August 9, Cape Chukotskoi was doubled, an important
event in the history of this expedition,&mdash;an event
which M&uuml;ller, in order to make results fit into his frame,
has not even mentioned. The name, it is true, is not
found in the journal, but it appears on Bering's chart in
Du Halde's work, which M&uuml;ller knew. Bering determined
the southern extremity of the cape to be 64&deg;
18', Cook 64&deg; 13'.</p>

<p>August 11, the weather was calm and cloudy. At
2 o'clock in the afternoon, they saw an island toward the
southeast, which Bering, in honor of the day, called St.
Lawrence. At noon the latitude was found to be 64&deg;
20', and hence the Gabriel was in the strait between
Asia and America.</p>

<p>August 12, there was a light breeze and cloudy weather.
On this day they sailed sixty-nine miles, but the difference
in latitude was only 29'. At sunset the longitude
was computed by the aid of the variation of the
needle to be 25&deg; 31' east of the lower Kamchatka fort,
or 187&deg; 21' east of Greenwich.</p>

<p>August 13, a fresh breeze and cloudy. Bering sailed
during the whole day with land in sight, and the difference
in latitude was only 78'.</p>

<p>August 14, weather calm and cloudy. They sailed 29
miles + 8&frac34; miles for the current. The course of the
current was from south southeast to north northwest.
At noon the latitude was 66&deg; 41' when they saw high
land astern, and three hours later high mountains. (East
Cape is 66&deg; 6' N. lat. and 190&deg; 21' east of Greenwich.)</p>

<p>August 15, gentle wind, cloudy weather. From noon
until 3 o'clock Bering sailed to the northeast, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
having sailed seven miles in this direction, he determined
to turn back. At 3 o'clock he announced, that as he
had now accomplished his task, it was his duty, according
to his orders, to return. His bearings were then
67&deg; 18' N. latitude, and 30&deg; 19' east of the Kamchatka
fort, or 193&deg; 7' east of Greenwich. In Du Halde, where
Bering himself gives his reasons, it is stated: "This was
Captain Bering's most northerly point. He thought that
he had accomplished his task and obeyed orders, especially
as he no longer could see the coast extending toward the
north in the same way. ("<i>Surtout, parcequ'il ne voyait
plus que les terres continuassent de courier de m&ecirc;me du c&ocirc;t&eacute;
du Nord.</i>") Moreover, if they should go farther, he feared,
in case they should have adverse winds that they might
not be able to return to Kamchatka before the end of
the summer, and how were they to be able to pass the
winter in such a climate, liable to fall into the hands of a
people who had not yet been subjugated, and who were
human only in outward appearance.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>When Bering turned about, his command was to steer
south by west, half west. In this course they sailed with
the wind at a rate of more than seven miles an hour. At
9 o'clock in the morning, they saw a high mountain on
the right, where Chukchees lived, and to the left and
seaward they saw an island, which in honor of the day
they called Diomede.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> This day they sailed 115 miles,
and reached latitude 66&deg; 2'.</p>

<p>On August 17, Bering again passed the narrowest part
of the strait. The weather was cloudy, there was a fresh
breeze, and they sailed along the Asiatic coast, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>they saw many Chukchees, and at two places they saw
dwellings. The natives fled at the sight of the ship. At
3 o'clock very high land and mountains were passed.
With a very good breeze, they had been enabled to sail
164 miles, and an observation showed that they were in
latitude 64&deg; 27'. According to this, Bering was out of
the strait and getting farther and farther away from the
American continent.</p>

<p>August 18, the wind was light and the weather clear.
On the 20th, beyond the Island of St. Lawrence, he met
other Chukchees, who told him that they had made journeys
from the Kolyma River westward to Olenek, but
that they never went by sea. They knew of the Anadyr
fort which lay farther to the south; on this coast there
dwelt people of their race; others they did not know.</p>

<p>After a storm on the 31st of August, in which the
main and foresail were rent, the anchor cable was broken
and the anchor lost, they reached the mouth of the Kamchatka
at 5 o'clock <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, September 2, 1728.</p>

THE TASK ASSIGNED BY PETER THE GREAT ACCOMPLISHED.&mdash;HISTORY
OF THE CARTOGRAPHY OF EAST
SIBERIA.&mdash;CAPTAIN COOK'S DEFENSE OF BERING.</h3>


<p>Bering turned back because he felt convinced that
he had sailed around the northeastern corner of
Asia, and had demonstrated that in this part of the
earth the two great continents were not connected.
The third point in his orders was of course dropped,
for along the Siberian coasts of the Arctic sea, he could
expect to find neither European colonists nor ships;
hence, further search with this object in view would be
vain. He had a very clear idea of the general outline
of eastern Asia, and this knowledge was based upon the
facts of his own voyage, the information he had obtained
in Yakutsk about Deshneff's expedition from
Kolyma to Anadyr, and upon the account which the
natives gave of the country and of their commercial
journeys westward to Olenek.</p>

<p>He was, moreover, convinced that he had given the
search for a Northeast passage a rational foundation,
and his thoughts on this subject are found clearly presented
in a correspondence from St. Petersburg to a
Copenhagen periodical, <i>Nye Tidende</i>, in 1730, whence
the following: "<i>Bering has ascertained that there really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
does exist a Northeast passage, and that from the Lena
River it is possible, provided one is not prevented by
polar ice, to sail to Kamchatka, and thence to Japan,
China, and the East Indies.</i>" This correspondence,
which appeared immediately after his return on the
first of March, 1730, originated either with him or with
some of his immediate friends, and shows that he fully
appreciated the extent of his discovery.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It was this
conviction that led him to undertake his next great
enterprise, the navigating and charting of the Northeast
passage from the Obi River to Japan,&mdash;from the
known West to the known East.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the principal result of his
work remains as above stated. An unhappy fate prevented
him from discovering the adjacent American
continent. At the narrowest place, Bering Strait is 39
miles wide; and hence, under favorable conditions, it is
possible to see simultaneously the coast-lines of both
continents.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Cook, more fortunate than Bering, was
enabled to do this, for when he approached the strait,
the sun dispersed the fog, and at one glance both continents
were seen. With Bering it was otherwise, for,
as we have seen from his journal, the weather during
the whole time that he was in the strait, both on the
voyage up and back, was dark and cloudy. Not until
the 18th of August did the weather clear up, but as
the Gabriel was sailing before a sharp breeze, he was
then too far away to see land on the other side.
"This," Von Baer exclaims, "must be called <i>bad
luck</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>We may possibly feel inclined to blame Bering for
his haste. Why did he not cruise about in the region
of 65&deg; to 67&deg; north latitude? A few hours' sailing would
have brought him to the American coast. This objection
may, however, prove to be illegitimate. The geographical
explorer, as well as every other investigator,
has a right to be judged from the standpoint of his
times, and on the basis of his own premises. Bering
had no apprehension of an adjacent continent, partly
on account of the Koriak interpreter's imperfect knowledge
of the Chukchee tongue, partly as a result of the
fact that the knowledge of the times concerning
the western coast of America was very meager. This
knowledge extended no farther than to 43&deg; north
latitude,&mdash;to Cape Blanco in California; hence, in the
nature of things, he could not be expected to search
for land which presumably he knew nothing of. But
here we must also take into consideration his poor
equipment. His cables, ropes, and sails were in such
bad condition, after the three years' transport through
Siberia, that he could not weather a storm, and his
stock of provisions was running so low that it put an
unpleasant check on any inclination to overreach his
main object, and this, as we have seen, did not include
the exploration of an American coast, if separated from
Asia. To explore a new coast thirteen degrees of latitude
and thirty degrees of longitude in extent, and make
such a chart of it that its outline is comparatively correct,
and which, for a long time, was far superior to anything
made afterward,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> ought certainly to be considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>a splendid result, when we remember that the objects of
the expedition were entirely of a nautico-geographical
character. Bering's determinations of longitude in East
Siberia were the first made there, and through them it
was ascertained that the country extended thirty degrees
farther toward the east than was supposed. His
observations were based on two eclipses of the moon in
Kamchatka in the years 1728 and 1729,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and although
they were not entirely accurate, they vary so little, that
the general position of the country was established.
And hence we are not surprised to find that no one has
given Bering a better testimonial than his great and
more fortunate successor, Captain Cook. He says:<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> "In
justice to the memory of Bering, I must say, that he has
delineated the coast very well, and fixed the latitude and
longitude of the points better than could be expected
from the methods he had to go by." Yes, Captain Cook
found it necessary to defend Bering against the only
official report of the expedition which at that time had
appeared, and more than once he puts in proper relief
Bering's sober investigations, as compared with M&uuml;ller's
fancies and guesses. Before the time of Cook, it had
been customary to depreciate Bering's work;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> but since
that time Admiral L&uuml;tke, a hundred years after Bering's
death, has defended his reputation, and Berch, who very
carefully perused his journals, repeatedly expresses his
admiration for the accuracy with which the nautical
computations were made. This statement is made after
a comparison of results with those obtained by Captain
Cook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Furthermore, as has already been said, Bering was
not aware of the fact that he was sailing in a comparatively
narrow sound,&mdash;in that strait which has carried
his name to posterity. He saw nothing beyond the
nearest of the Diomede Islands, that is to say, the
middle of the strait; and this island, as we have seen,
is mentioned in the journal and on the chart, with the
latitude correctly given.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> His name was not immediately
associated with these regions. The first place, so
far as I am able to ascertain, that the name Bering
Strait appears, is on a map which accompanies Rob. de
Vangondie's "<i>M&eacute;moire sur les pays de l'Asie</i>," Paris,
1774. But it is especially to Captain Cook's high-mindedness
that the name was retained, for it was used in
his great work. Later, Reinholdt Forster, who characterizes
Bering as "a meritorious and truly great navigator,"
triumphantly fought his cause against B&uuml;sching
and others.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>But even at the present time, an interesting misunderstanding
attaches to this part of Bering's history and the
cartography of these regions. In our Arctic literature
and on all our polar maps, it is asserted that Vitus Bering,
on his first voyage, turned back at Cape Serdze Kamen.
That such a supposition has been able to maintain itself,
only shows how little the original sources of his history
are known in West Europe, and how unheeded they have
been in Russia. About a hundred years ago the Danish
Admiral De L&ouml;wen&ouml;rn and the English hydrographer A.
Dalrymple showed that Frobisher Strait had by some
ignorant hand been located on the east coast of Greenland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>while it was in reality located on the coast of <i>Meta
incognita</i> beyond Davis Strait.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> A similar error presents
itself in connection with Serdze Kamen. It can be historically
established that this name has been the object of
a double change, and that the present Serdze Kamen
on the northern coast of the Chukchee peninsula, has
nothing whatever to do with the history of Bering and
his voyage. This misunderstanding is, however, not of
recent date, for as early as in the first decade after the
voyage, it was assumed that Bering's course, even after
he had passed East Cape, was along the coast. Thus I
find on a map by Hazius in Nuremberg, 1738,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and other
maps of about the same time, based on Bering's map as
given by Du Halde, that the Gabriel's turning point is
marked by a star near the coast with the same latitude as
the present Serdze Kamen, with the following explanation:
"<i>Terminus litorum a Navarcho Beerings recognitorum.</i>"
This supposition gradually gained ground in
West Europe as well as in Russia, especially so, too, as
Bering's new expedition and consequent death prevented
him from correcting the error, and as there for a generation
was nothing more known of the voyage than the
resum&eacute; which appears in Du Halde's work. Moreover,
the manner in which the coast-line in Bering's original
map is extended beyond East Cape, has only served to
strengthen the opinion. The fact is that Serdze Kamen
was a name unknown to Bering. It is found neither on
his map, in his own account, nor in the ship's journal,
and could not be so found for a very obvious reason&mdash;Bering
had never been there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>After having passed East Cape on the 14th of August,
he no longer sailed along the coast. On that day
at noon they still saw land astern, and three hours
later, high mountains, but during the succeeding forty-eight
hours land was seen neither to the east nor the
west.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the journal gives the turning point
as 4&deg; 44' east of Cape Chukotskoi, and Dr. Campbell
gives another series of astronomical determinations, sent
by Bering from Kamchatka to the Senate in St. Petersburg,
and these show in a striking way that the turning
point was east of the northeastern corner of Asia.</p>

<p>According to these:<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The Island of St. Lawrence is 64&deg; north latitude and
122&deg; 55' east of Tobolsk.</p>

<p>The Island of Diomede is 66&deg; north latitude and 125&deg;
42' east of Tobolsk.</p>

<p>The turning point, 67&deg; 18' north latitude and 126&deg; 7'
east of Tobolsk.</p>

<p>Hence, Serdze Kamen (67&deg; 3' north latitude and 188&deg;
11' east of Greenwich), as Berch<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> expressly remarks, must
have lain more than four degrees west of the turning
point. That this must have been so appears also from
the course of the vessel on its return, west southwest,
which would have been impossible, if the Gabriel had
been near the north coast, intending to return through
the strait. Among recent writers, Von Baer<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> alone critically
calls attention to these facts, without, however,
thoroughly investigating the case. This I shall now
attempt to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>The name Serdze Kamen appears for the first time&mdash;historically
speaking&mdash;in Gerhard Fr. M&uuml;ller's <i>Sammlung
Russischer Geschichte</i>, Vol. III., 1758.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He says:
"Bering finally, in a latitude of 67&deg; 18', reached a headland
whence the coast recedes to the west. From this the
captain drew the very plausible conclusion that he now
had reached the most northeasterly point of Asia. But
here we are forced to admit that the circumstance upon
which the captain based his conclusion was false, as it has
since been learned that the above-mentioned headland
was identical with the one called Serdze Kamen by the
inhabitants of Fort Anadyr, on account of the promontory
being heart-shaped." Even this looks suspicious.
The account of some ignorant Cossacks is presented as a
corrective to the report of educated navigators, and it is
also indicated that the garrison at Fort Anadyr had exact
knowledge of the northern coast of the Chukchee peninsula,
something it did not have at all.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>But in order to understand M&uuml;ller, it is necessary to
make a slight digression. When Bering, in the summer of
1729, was on his return to St. Petersburg, he met, between
Okhotsk and Yakutsk, the Cossack chief Shestakoff, who
by the aid of Bering's ships intended to undertake an
extensive military expedition in the eastern seas. He
soon fell, however, in an engagement, but his comrade
Captain Pavlutski led an invasion into the land of the
Chukchees. From Fort Anadyr he went northward to
the Arctic Ocean, thence along the coast toward the east,
then across the Chukchee peninsula to the Pacific. A
more detailed account than this cannot be given, for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>route as indicated on M&uuml;ller's map is an impossible one.
This much, however, seems to be irrefutable: shortly
after having crossed the Chukchee peninsula in a southerly
direction, he came to a sea, and this sea could be no
other than Bering Sea.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Moreover, it appears from the
account, that he was on his return to the fort. M&uuml;ller
goes on to say: "From here he sent a part of his men in
boats, whither he himself with the majority of the party
proceeded by land, following the shore, which at this
place extended toward the southeast. Those in boats
were so near the shore that they reported to him every
evening. On the seventh day, the party in boats came to
the mouth of a river, and twelve days later, to the mouth
of another. At about seven miles from this point there
extends eastward far into the sea a headland, which is
first mountainous, but then flat, as far as the eye can
reach. This headland is probably what induced Captain
Bering to turn back. Among the mountains on this promontory
there is one which, as already noted, is by the
natives of Anadyrskoi Ostrog called Serdze Kamen.
From here Pavlutski started for the interior." On this
loose reasoning rests Serdze Kamen,&mdash;a process of reasoning
which attempts to show clearly that this headland
must be a point on the Pacific coast, and that it must
have lain many days' journey west of Bering Strait.
But how is it possible, that M&uuml;ller could have been so
confused as to make such strange blunders? The case
could not thus have presented itself to him. On the
basis of Deshneff's journey and Pavlutski's cruise, he
formed in his imagination a picture of northeastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>Siberia, in which the Chukchee peninsula assumed a
double horned shape, or&mdash;as Von Baer expresses it&mdash;resembled
a bull's horn.</p>

<p>He used Bering's chart as a foundation when he had
no other, but he omitted Cape Chukotskoi, and on the
66th parallel he inserted Serdze Kamen. From this point
he made the coast recede, first westward, then northward
and eastward to a large circular peninsula situated between
72&deg;-75&deg; north latitude, which he called Chukotskoi
Noss. It is this imaginary peninsula which Pavlutski
crosses. He accordingly reaches the Pacific coast to the
north of Bering Strait, and in this way M&uuml;ller succeeds
in locating Serdze Kamen north of the strait. Hence,
according to M&uuml;ller's opinion, Bering had never doubled
the northeastern corner of Asia, and he had never been
out of the Pacific. "And although the coast beyond
Serdze Kamen," he says, "turns westward, it forms only
a large bay, and the coast-line again takes a northerly
direction to Chukotskoi Noss, a large peninsula in a latitude
of 70&deg; or more, and where it would first be possible
to say authoritatively that the two hemispheres were not
connected. But how could all this have been known on
the ship? The correct idea of the shape of the land of
the Chukchees and the peninsula bearing the same name,
is due to geographical investigations instituted by me at
Yakutsk in 1736 and 1737."</p>

<p>Blinded by the archival dust of Yakutsk, M&uuml;ller confused
everything. Cape Chukotskoi, which Bering had
found to be in latitude 64&deg; 18' N., was placed beyond 72&deg;
N.; Bering's most northerly point, which lay far out in
the sea, was changed to a headland in latitude 66&deg; N.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and, misled by some vague reports from the garrison at
Fort Anadyr, he called this point Serdze Kamen. Everything
is guess-work!</p>

<p>But where did M&uuml;ller get his Serdze Kamen, and
what place was it that the garrison at Fort Anadyr called
by this name? For of the extreme northeast part of the
peninsula, or the details of Bering's voyage&mdash;especially
as early as in 1730&mdash;they could have had no knowledge.
The explanation is not difficult. On Russian maps of the
last century, those of Pallas and Billings, for example,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
there is found on the eastern shore of St. Kresta Bay, somewhat
northeast of the mouth of the Anadyr, a cape which
bears the name of Serdze Kamen. As Bering does not have
this name, and as it seems to have been known as early as at
the time of Pavlutski, it must have originated either with
him and the Cossacks at the fort, or with the Chukchees.
Sauer relates the following concerning the origin of the
name: "Serdze Kamen is a very remarkable mountain
projecting into the bay at Anadyr. The land side of this
mountain has many caves, to which the Chukchees fled
when Pavlutski attacked them, and from where they
killed a large number of Russians as they passed. Pavlutski
was consequently obliged to seek reinforcements at
Anadyr, where he told that the Chukchees shot his men
from the <i>heart</i> of the <i>cliff</i>, and hence it received the
name of Serdze Kamen, or the heart-cliff." But this
account, which finds no authority whatever in Sauer's
work, is severely criticised by L&uuml;tke, who calls attention
to the fact that the Chukchees called a mountain on the
eastern shore of the St. Kresta Bay <i>Linglin Ga&iuml;</i>, that is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>the heart-cliff. It is quite improbable that they got this
name from the Cossacks in Anadyrsk, and hence we here
undoubtedly have the origin of the name.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>In Steller's various works one can see what confused
ideas concerning Bering's first expedition the academists
who wrote his history really had. They succeeded in
bringing confusion into the simplest questions, and, as a
result, wrecked his reputation. In Steller's description of
Kamchatka, where he enumerates the headlands of the
peninsula, a remarkable statement is found, which offers
excellent proof of the correctness of L&uuml;tke's opinion.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
The situation of Serdze Kamen between East Cape and
the mouth of the Anadyr is here distinctly given.
Hence, according to his opinion, Bering reached no
farther than to St. Kresta Bay, and the sarcastic remarks
plainly show Steller's partisan view.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> M&uuml;ller was not so
rash. When he moved Cape Chukotskoi half a dozen
degrees farther to the north, he moved Serdze Kamen
also, and <i>carried it from St. Kresta Bay up into Bering
Strait</i>.</p>

<p>In this cool move he was fortunate enough to get into
a closer agreement with Bering's determination of latitude,
but unfortunately hit upon new difficulties. His
own map is based upon Bering's, as he had no other, but
Bering's voyage did not, as is well known, end at any
headland. Neither his chart nor his journal supports
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>any such theory, and hence M&uuml;ller, either accidentally or
purposely, does not in his book have a word about the
voyage from the 10th to the 15th of August, and on his
map (1758) Bering's "track" is broken off near East
Cape. This headland is M&uuml;ller's Serdze Kamen,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> a fact
of which even a very cursory glance at M&uuml;ller's and
Bering's maps will convince any one. But even Bering
had located the northeastern corner of Asia (East Cape)
a few minutes too far northward, and in order to make
the map coincide with his theory and with Bering's computations,
M&uuml;ller made the error greater, without, however,
fixing it at Bering's turning-point, but at 67&deg; 18'
N. lat., where, according to Bering's and his own
account, it ought to be.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood up to the time of Cook's third
voyage. But as Cook had on board, not only M&uuml;ller's
book and map in an English translation, but also Bering's
map, and an excellent treatise by Dr. Campbell in
Harris's Collection of Voyages, he could pass judgment
while at the place in question. As a matter of course he
upholds Bering. Hence, it was a natural result that
Serdze Kamen, which, as we have seen, was to coincide
with the most northerly point reached by Bering, could
no longer retain its position in the latitude of East Cape,
which was more than a degree too far south; and in
order to make M&uuml;ller's account intelligible, Captain Cook
had the choice between entirely expunging the name, or
bringing it up to an approximately correct latitude.
Cook chose the latter; and to this mistake on his part it
is due that the last splinter of M&uuml;ller's vain structure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>passed into the cartography of the future. In latitude
67&deg; 3' N., Cook found a projecting promontory with
many crags and peaks, and "possibly one or another of
them may be heart-shaped. This peak we have, on M&uuml;ller's
authority, called Serdze Kamen."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Here then we have the third Serdze Kamen, and we
can now see how it has wandered about the northeast
corner of Asia. As a matter of fact, it is situated in a
latitude nearly the same as the most northerly point
reached by Bering, but unfortunately this does not at all
answer M&uuml;ller's description. It does not project eastward
into the sea, but on the contrary, its main direction
is toward the northwest. At the base of this headland,
the coast does not in a striking manner extend toward
the west, but continues in its former direction. Nor does
it consist of steep rocks and a low point extending farther
than the eye can reach. In other words, the present
Serdze Kamen has nothing whatever to do either with
Bering's voyage or M&uuml;ller's description.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>To this period of Bering's history another observation
must be made. In his excellent treatise entitled, "What
Geography owes to Peter the Great," Von Baer tries to
show that Bering turned back in his course, not on the
15th, but on the 16th of August, and that too, notwithstanding
the fact that both Bering and M&uuml;ller, in print,
give the former date,&mdash;yes, notwithstanding the fact that
Von Baer himself had an autograph card from Bering
which likewise gives the 15th. In his criticism on this
point, Von Baer based his statements on those extracts of
the ship's journal referred to above, which as we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>seen give the 16th of August, and this, in his opinion,
must be decisive. But the disagreement in these sources
is only an apparent one. As we already have noted,
Bering reckoned the day from 12 o'clock at noon. Hence
the journal's 16th of August began at noon on the 15th
of August, and as Bering turned back at 3 o'clock in the
afternoon, this occurred on the 15th of August according
to the calendar, and on the 16th of August according to
the artificial day of the journal. Thus Von Baer's correction
is based on a misunderstanding.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> That this view
of the question is correct is seen also from that passage in
the journal where the Island of St. Lawrence is mentioned.
According to the journal this island was passed
at 2 o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on the 11th of August, and Berch, to
whom we are indebted for information concerning Bering's
day, is, strange to say, surprised to think that
Bering named the island in honor of the saint of the preceding
day, notwithstanding that the 11th at 2 o'clock
<span class="smcap">P. M.</span> is in reality, according to the calendar day, the 10th
of August, St. Lawrence Day. The first twelve hours of
the journal's day belong to the preceding day. Hence,
Bering turned back August 15, at 3 o'clock <span class="smcap">P. M.</span></p>

BERING'S WINTER AT THE FORT.&mdash;INDICATIONS OF AN
ADJACENT CONTINENT.&mdash;UNSUCCESSFUL SEARCH FOR
THIS CONTINENT.&mdash;RETURN TO ST. PETERSBURG.&mdash;GENERAL
REVIEW OF THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST
EXPEDITION.</h3>


<p>When Bering on the 2d of September, 1728,
entered the mouth of the river Kamchatka, he
met the Fortuna, which had made a voyage around the
Kamchatka Peninsula. Who commanded the vessel on
this voyage, can not be ascertained.</p>

<p>Bering wintered at the fort. On the days that it was
light, the men were busy at work or receiving instructions,
and thus the winter passed without any remarkable
occurrences or misfortunes. Spangberg, however, was
obliged, on account of illness, to go to Bolsheretsk.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>At lower Kamchatskoi Ostrog, Bering became convinced
that there must be a large wooded country not
far to the east. The waves were more like those of a
sea than of an ocean. The driftwood did not indicate
the flora of eastern Asia, and the depth of the sea grew
less toward the north; the east wind brought drift-ice
to the mouth of the river after three days, the
north wind, on the other hand, after five days. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>birds of passage came to Kamchatka from the east.
The reports of the natives corroborated his inferences.
They declared that they were able, in very clear weather,
to see land in the east (Bering Island), and that in
the year 1715 a man had stranded there, who said that
his native land was far to the east and had large rivers
and forests with very high trees. All this led Bering
to believe that a large country lay toward the northeast
at no very great distance.</p>

<p>In the summer or 1729, he started out to find this
country, leaving the mouth of the Kamchatka for
the east, July 6. If the wind had been favourable, he
would very soon have reached Bering Island, where
twelve years later he was buried. He must have been
very near this island, invisible to him, however, on
account of a fog; but on the 8th of July he was struck
by a severe storm, which the frail vessel and the weather-worn
rigging could not defy, and hence on the 9th,
he headed for the southern point of Kamchatka. But
also on this voyage he did geographical service by
determining the location of the peninsula and the
northern Kurile Islands, as well as exploring the channel
between them, and thus finding for the Russian
mariner a new and easier route to Kamchatka. Berch
says, that although Bering had adverse winds on the
voyage to Bolsheretsk, all his computations are quite
accurate; the difference in latitude between the latter
place and lower Kamchatka Ostrog is given as 6&deg; 29',
which is very nearly correct. Bering likewise determined
the location of Cape Lopatka at 51&deg; N. lat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>At Bolsheretsk Bering collected his men, distributed
provisions and powder, left the Fortuna with a crew
of one corporal and eleven men, and on the 14th of
July steered for Okhotsk. After a fortunate, but not
otherwise remarkable, journey, he reached St. Petersburg
on the 1st of March, 1730. "From the perusal
of his ship's journal," says Berch, "one becomes convinced
that our famous Bering was an extraordinarily
able and skillful officer; and if we consider his defective
instruments, his great hardships, and the obstacles
that had to be overcome, his observations and the great
accuracy of his journal deserve the highest praise. He
was a man who did Russia honor."</p>

<p>Bering had thus done good work in the service of
Asiatic geography. He had shown that he possessed
an explorer's most important qualification&mdash;never to
make positive statements where there is no definite
knowledge. By virtue of his extensive travels in northeastern
Asia, his scientific qualifications, his ability to
make careful, accurate observations, and his own astronomical
determinations, and by virtue of his direct
acquaintance with Kosyrefsky's and Lushin's works, he
was in a position to form a more correct opinion than
any contemporary concerning this part of the earth.
In spite of these great advantages in his favor, his
work was rejected by the leading authorities in St.
Petersburg. It is true that Bering found sincere support
in the able and influential Ivan Kirilovich Kiriloff,
but to no one else could he turn for a just and competent
judge. The great Russian empire had not yet
produced a scientific aristocracy. The Academy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Science, which had been founded five or six years previous,
was not composed of able scholars, but of a number
of more or less talented contestants for honor and
fame,&mdash;of men who occupied a prominent yet disputed
position in a foreign and hostile country&mdash;young, hot-headed
Germans and Frenchmen who had not yet
achieved complete literary recognition. Such people
are stern and severe judges. Bering was unfortunate
enough to fall into the hands of the German Gerhard
Fr. M&uuml;ller and the Frenchman Joseph Nicolas De l'Isle.</p>

<p>Although M&uuml;ller had not yet seen Siberia, and
although it was not until ten years later that he succeeded
in building that geographical card-house which
Captain Cook so noiselessly blew down, he nevertheless,
even at that time, on every occasion expressed the opinion
that Bering had not reached the northeast point
of Asia, and that his voyage had consequently not
accomplished its purpose. De l'Isle was Bering's intellectual
antipode. As a geographer he delighted in
moving about on the borderland of the world's unexplored
regions. His element was that of vaguest conjecture,&mdash;the
boldest combinations of known and
unknown; and even as an old man he did not shrink
from the task of constructing, from insufficient accounts
of travels and apocryphal sailor-stories, a map of the
Pacific, of which not a single line has been retained. He
overstrained himself on the fame of his deceased brother,
whose methods, inclinations, and valuable geographical
collections he had inherited, but unfortunately not that
intuitive insight which made Guillaume De l'Isle the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
leading geographer of his age. Hence, as a geographer,
he was merely an echo of his brother.</p>

<p>One of Guillaume De l'Isle's most famous essays had
been on the island of Yezo. In 1643 the stadtholder of
Batavia, the able Van Diemen, sent the ships Kastrikon
and Breskens under the command of Martin de
Vries and Hendrick Corneliszoon Schaep to Japan for
the purpose of navigating the east coast of the island of
Nipon (Hondo), and thence go in search of America by
sailing in a northwesterly direction to the 45th degree of
latitude; but in case they did not find America, which
people continued to believe lay in these regions, they
were to turn toward the northeast and seek the coast of
Asia on the 56th degree of latitude. De Vries partly
carried out his chimerical project. At 40&deg; north latitude
he saw the coast of Nipon, two degrees farther north,
the snow-capped mountains of Yezo, and thence sailed
between the two Kuriles lying farthest to the south,
which he called Staaten Eiland and Kompagniland. He
then continued his voyage into the Sea of Okhotsk to
48&deg; north latitude, where he turned about, saw Yezo in
latitude 45&deg;, but came, without noticing La Perouse
Strait, over to Saghalin, which he considered a part of
Yezo, and as he followed the coast of Saghalin to Cape
Patience in latitude 48&deg;, he thought Yezo a very extensive
island on the eastern coast of Asia. Through the
cartography of the seventeenth century, for example
Witsen's and Homann's Atlas, but especially through Guillaume
De l'Isle's globes and maps, these erroneous ideas
were scattered over the earth, and, when the first accounts
of Kamchatka, without being accompanied by a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
astronomical determination, reached Europe, many believed
that this land was identical with Yezo. But as
De Vries had left some determinations of latitude and
longitude which showed that the island must be very near
Japan, some went even so far as to suppose that it was
contiguous to Nipon; indeed, Guillaume De l'Isle's essay
attempted to prove this. Thus three lands were made
one, while De Vries's Staaten Eiland and Kompagniland,
which could find no place in this series, were forced eastward
into the Pacific as large tracts of land separated
from Kamchatka-Yezo and from each other by narrow
straits. But this is not all. The Portuguese cosmographer
Texe&iuml;ra had in 1649, in these same regions, indicated
a coast projecting far to the east toward America,
seen by Juan de Gama on a voyage to New Spain from
the Philippine Islands. This Gamaland was now described
as a continuation of Kompagniland. In Homann's
Atlas, 1709, it is represented as a part of America, and
Guillaume De l'Isle varied on the theme in a different
way.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately these ideas held sway in the scientific
world when Bering, in 1730, returned. Furthermore,
scholars thought these ideas were confirmed by Swedish
prisoners of war who had returned from Siberia, especially
by the famous Tabbert, or Strahlenberg, as he was
later called, whose various imaginary chart-outlines had
been adopted in Homann's Atlas, 1727, and in other West
European geographical works then in vogue.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Bering returned. His sober accounts and accurate
maps, in which there was nothing imaginary whatever,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>were now to take up the fight against these prejudices.
Bering declared that he had sailed around Kamchatka
without having seen anything of these lands, although he
had&mdash;in a different direction, however&mdash;noticed signs of
land. On his map, Kamchatka was represented as a definitely
defined region, and hence Guillaume De l'Isle's
structure had received its first blow, in case Bering's
representations should be accepted. But Bering's reputation
had been undermined in still another direction.
The above-mentioned Cossack chief Shestakoff had, during
his sojourn in Russia, distributed various rough contour
sketches of northeastern Asia. This brave warrior,
however, knew just as little about wielding a pen as he
did a pencil. The matter of a few degrees more or less in
some coast-lines did not seriously trouble him. Even his
own drawings did not agree. Northeast of the Chukchee
peninsula he had sketched an extensive country, which
Bering had not seen.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of Joseph De l'Isle that he accepted
both Shestakoff and Strahlenberg, and as late as in 1753
still clung to their outlines. In the first place, it satisfied
his family pride to be able to maintain his brother's views
of the cartography of these regions (and of his views
Strahlenberg's were but an echo), and it moreover satisfied
his predisposition to that which was vague and hypothetical.
At first De l'Isle succeeded in carrying out his
wishes, and in 1737 the Academy published a map of Asia
in which it would prove extremely difficult to find any
trace of Bering's discoveries.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> It was accordingly quite
the proper thing to consider Bering's first expedition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>wholly, or at least to a great extent, unsuccessful. In
the literature of that day there are evidences of this,
especially in Steller's writings. He treats Bering with
scornful superiority, which is particularly out of place,
as he shows himself a poor judge in geographical matters.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Kiriloff, who in his general map of Russia in
1734<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> unreservedly accepted Bering's map, was the only
man who gave him due recognition. The Academy could
not persuade itself to make use of the only scientifically
obtained outline map in existence of the remotest regions
of the empire, until Bering, many years afterwards, had
won full recognition in Paris, Nuremberg, and London.
Bering's map was made in Moscow in 1731, and the Russian
government presented it to the king of Poland,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
who gave it to the Jesuit father Du Halde. He had it
printed and inserted in D'Anville's <i>Nouvelle Atlas de la
Chine</i>, a supplement to his large work on China, to which
we have several times referred.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Of this work Dr. Campbell
later gave an account in Harris's Collection of Voyages,
and it was, furthermore, the basis of the better
class of geographical works on eastern Asia of last century
until Captain Cook's day. A copy of the eastern
half of the map will be found in the appendix to this
treatise.</p>

BERING'S PLANS FOR A SECOND EXPEDITION.&mdash;THE GREATEST
GEOGRAPHICAL ENTERPRISE EVER UNDERTAKEN.</h3>


<p>Arctic exploration has a bewitching power over its
devotees. Bering and his companions did not
escape the enchantment. Hardly had they returned
from a five years' sojourn in the extremest corner of the
world, when they declared themselves willing to start
out again. As they had met with so much doubt and
opposition from scholars,&mdash;had learned that the world's
youngest marine lacked the courage to recognize its own
contributions to science, and, furthermore, as the Admiralty
thought it had given strong reasons for doubting
Bering's results,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> he proposed to make his future explorations
on a larger scale and remove all doubt, by charting
the whole of this disputed part of the globe.</p>

<p>April 30, 1730, only two months after his return, he
presented two plans to the Admiralty. These have been
found and published by Berch, and are of the greatest
importance in judging of Bering's true relation to the
Great Northern Expedition. In the first of these propositions
he sets forth a series of suggestions for the
administration of East Siberia, and for a better utilization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>of its resources. He desired, among other things,
missionary work among the Yakuts, better discipline
among the East Siberian Cossacks, more honesty among
the yassak-collectors, the opening of iron mines at
Okhotsk and Udinsk, and various other things. But it
was never his intention to carry out these propositions
himself, and it was a great mistake for the government
to burden his instructions with such purely administrative
work.</p>

<p>His second proposition is incomparably more interesting.
In this he indicates the general outline of his
Great Northern Expedition, the greatest geographical
enterprise that the world has hitherto known. This
document shows that he was the originator of the plan,
something that has been contradicted, and but for this
document might still stand contradicted. He proposed
to start out from Kamchatka to explore and chart the
western coast of America and establish commercial relations
with that country, thence to visit Japan and
Amoor for the same purpose, and finally to chart either
by land or sea the Arctic coast of Siberia,&mdash;namely, from
the Obi to the Lena.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Through these three enterprises
and his former expedition, it was Bering's object to fill
the vacant space on his chart between the known West
and the known East,&mdash;between the Kara Sea and the
Japan Islands. He refused to corroborate his first
observations by again visiting the same localities, and
he rightly concluded, that absolute proof of the separation
of the continents would be ascertained if the
American coast were charted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>The political situation in the empire favored the adoption
of Bering's plans. The Duchess of Courland, Anna
Ivanovna, had just (1730) ascended the throne. With her
the foreigners and Peter's reform party again came into
power, and with much more zeal than skill, they sought
to continue Peter's work. Anna aimed to shine in Europe
as the ruler of a great power, and in Russia as a
West European queen. Europe was to be awed by Russian
greatness, and Russia by European wisdom. In one
of his high-flown speeches Czar Peter had given assurance
that science would forsake its abodes in West Europe,
and in the fullness of time cast a halo of immortal glory
around the name of Russia.</p>

<p>It was necessary to speed this time. Anna and her coadjutors
had an insatiable desire for the splendor and
exterior luster of culture. Like upstarts in wealth they
sought to surround themselves with some of that glory
which only gray-haired honor can bestow. One of the
surest ways to this glory was through the equipment of
scientific expeditions. They had at their disposal an
academy of science, a fleet, and the resources of a mighty
empire. The sacrifice of a few thousand human lives
troubled them but little, and they exerted themselves to
make the enterprise as large and sensational as possible.
Bering's above-mentioned proposition was taken as a
foundation for these plans, but when, after the lapse of
two years, his proposition left the various departments of
the government&mdash;the Senate, the Academy, and the
Admiralty&mdash;it had assumed such proportions that he
found great difficulty in recognizing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>After having on April 30, 1730, submitted to the
Admiralty his new proposition, together with the accounts
and reports of his first expedition, Bering was sent
to Moscow, where Anna maintained her court during the
first few years of her reign. Here he laid his plans
before the Senate, and made the map before referred to;
but all the leading men were then too much occupied
with court intrigues to be able to give his plans any of
their attention. Separated from his family, he wearied
of life in Moscow, and on January 5, 1732, the Senate
gave him leave of absence to go to St. Petersburg, on
condition that Chaplin and the steward would conclude
the reports. Moreover, the Senate ordered that the
Admiralty should pay Bering's claims against the government
for his services. In view of the hardships he had
endured, he received 1,000 rubles, double the amount to
which he was entitled according to the regulations of the
department. Almost simultaneously he was promoted, in
regular succession, to the position of <i>capitain-commandeur</i>
in the Russian fleet, the next position below that of
rear-admiral.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1732, Anna, Biron, and Ostermann
had succeeded in crushing the Old Russian opposition.
The leaders of this party, especially the family of Dolgoruki,
had been either banished to Siberia or scattered
about in the provinces and in fortresses, and now there
was nothing to hinder the government in pursuing its
plans. As early as April 17, the Empress<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> ordered that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>Bering's proposition should be executed, and charged the
Senate to take the necessary steps for this purpose. The
Senate, presided over by Ivan Kiriloff, an enthusiastic
admirer of Peter the Great, acted with dispatch. On
May 2, it promulgated two ukases, in which it declared
the objects of the expedition, and sought to indicate the
necessary means. Although the Senate here in the main
followed Bering's own proposition and made a triple
expedition (an American, a Japanese, and an Arctic), it
nevertheless betrayed a peculiar inclination to burden the
chief of the expedition with tasks most remote from his
own original plans. It directed him not only to explore
the Shantar Islands and reach the Spanish possessions in
America, something that Bering had never thought of,
but also included in its ukase a series of recommendations
for the development of Siberia,&mdash;recommendations which
Bering had previously made to the government, and
which had already provoked some definite efforts, as the
exiled Pissarjeff, a former officer of the Senate, had been
removed to Okhotsk to develop that region and extend
the maritime relations on the Pacific.</p>

<p>He seems, however, not to have accomplished anything,
and the Senate thought it feasible to burden
Bering with a part of this task. He was directed to
supply Okhotsk with more inhabitants, to introduce
cattle-raising on the Pacific coast, to found schools in
Okhotsk for both elementary and nautical instruction, to
establish a dock-yard in this out-of-the-way corner, to
transport men and horses to Yudomskaya Krest, and to
establish iron-works at Yakutsk, Udinsk, and other places.
But this was simply the beginning of the avalanche, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
as it rolled along down through the Admiralty and
Academy, it assumed most startling dimensions. These
authorities aspired to nothing less than raising all human
knowledge one step higher. The Admiralty desired the
expedition to undertake the nautical charting of the Old
World from Archangel to Nipon&mdash;even to Mexico; and
the Academy could not be satisfied with anything less
than a scientific exploration of all northern Asia. As a
beginning, Joseph Nicolas De l'Isle, professor of astronomy
at the Academy, was instructed to give a graphic
account of the present state of knowledge of the North
Pacific, and in a memoir to give Bering instructions how
to find America from the East. The Senate also decreed
that the former's brother, Louis, surnamed La Croy&egrave;re,
an adventurer of somewhat questionable character, should
accompany the expedition as astronomer. Thus decree
after decree followed in rapid succession. On December
28, the Senate issued a lengthy ukase, which, in sixteen
paragraphs, outlined <i>in extenso</i> the nautico-geographical
explorations to be undertaken by the expedition. Commodore
Bering and Lieut. Chirikoff, guided by the instructions
of the Academy, were to sail to America with
two ships for the purpose of charting the American coast.
They were to be accompanied by La Croy&egrave;re, who, with
the assistance of the surveyors Krassilnikoff and Popoff,
was to undertake a series of local observations through
Siberia, along several of the largest rivers of the country
and in its more important regions, across the Pacific, and
also along the coast of the New World. With three ships
Spangberg was to sail to the Kurile Islands, Japan, and
the still more southerly parts of Asia, while simultaneously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the coast from Okhotsk to Uda, to Tugur, to the
mouth of the Amoor, and the coasts of the Shantar
Islands and Saghalin were to be charted.</p>

<p>Even these tasks exceeded all reasonable demands, and
not until several generations later did Cook, La Perouse,
and Vancouver succeed in accomplishing what the Russian
Senate in a few pen-strokes directed Bering to do.
And yet, not until the government touched the Arctic
side of this task, did it entirely lose sight of all reason.
Its instructions to Bering were, not only to chart the
coast of the Old World from the Dwina to the Pacific, to
explore harbors and estuaries along this coast, to describe
the country and study its natural resources, especially its
mineral wealth, but also to dispatch an expedition to the
Bear Islands, off the mouth of the Kolyma, and to see to
it that his earlier trip to the Chukchee peninsula was
repeated, besides sailing from there to America, as the
results of his former voyage "were unsatisfactory," reliable
information concerning that country having been
received from the Cossack Melnikoff.</p>

<p>All these expeditions were to start out from the great
Siberian rivers,&mdash;from the Dwina to the Obi with two
vessels under the charge of the Admiralty; from the Obi
and Lena with three twenty-four-oared boats, two of
which were to meet between these two rivers, and the
third was to sail around Bering's Peninsula (this Reclus
calls the Chukchee peninsula), or, if America proved to
be connected with that country, it was to attempt to find
European colonies. The orders of the Senate were, furthermore,
to the effect that surveyors should be sent out
in advance for the preliminary charting of these river-mouths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and to erect light-houses, establish magazines for
convenient relays, and procure provisions and other
necessaries,&mdash;very excellent directions, all of which, however,
were so many meaningless words after they had left
the government departments. Our age, which still has
in mind the Franklin expeditions&mdash;the English parallel&mdash;is
able to form an idea of these gigantic demands, and yet
the Senate did not hesitate to load the organization of all
this upon the shoulders of one man. Bering was made
chief of all the enterprises east of the Ural Mountains.
At the Obi and the Lena, at Okhotsk and Kamchatka,
he was to furnish ships, provisions, and transportation.</p>

<p>But in spite of all that was vague and visionary in
these plans, they had nevertheless a certain homogeneity.
They were all nautical expeditions for nautical purposes
and nautico-geographical investigations. Then the
Academy added its demands, making everything doubly
complicated. It demanded a scientific exploration of all
Siberia and Kamchatka,&mdash;not only an account of these
regions based on astronomical determinations and geodetic
surveys, on minute descriptions and artistically executed
landscape pictures, on barometric, thermometric, and
aerometric observations, as well as investigations in all
the branches of natural history, but it demanded also a
detailed presentation of the ethnography, colonization,
and history of the country, together with a multitude of
special investigations in widely different directions.
The leading spirits in these enterprises were two young
and zealous Germans, the chemist Johann Georg Gmelin
and the historian Gerhard Friedrich M&uuml;ller, twenty-eight
and twenty-four years of age respectively, members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
of the Academy, and later, highly respected scholars.
M&uuml;ller was a personal friend of Bering, and through him
got a desire to participate in the expedition.</p>

<p>Kiriloff, the secretary of the Senate, himself a successful
student of geography, supported the efforts of the
Academy, and most generously gratified all the exaggerated
demands that only imperious and inexperienced
devotees of science could present. Indeed, Bering could
not but finally consider himself fortunate in escaping a
sub-expedition to Central Asia, one of Kiriloff's pet plans,
which the latter afterwards took upon himself to carry
out. The Academic branch of the expedition, which thus
came to consist of the astronomer La Croy&egrave;re, the physicist
Gmelin (the elder), and the historian M&uuml;ller, was right
luxuriously equipped. It was accompanied by two landscape
painters, one surgeon, one interpreter, one instrument-maker,
five surveyors, six scientific assistants, and
fourteen body-guards. Moreover, this convoy grew like an
avalanche, as it worked its way into Siberia. La Croy&egrave;re
had nine wagon-loads of instruments, among them telescopes
thirteen and fifteen feet in length. These Academical
gentlemen had at least thirty-six horses, and on the
large rivers, they could demand boats with cabins. They
carried with them a library of several hundred volumes, not
only of scientific and historical works in their specialties,
but also of the Latin classics and such light reading as
Robinson Crusoe and Gulliver's Travels. Besides, they
had seventy reams of writing paper and an enormous
supply of artists' colors, draughting materials and apparatus.
All archives were to be open to them, all Siberian
government authorities were to be at their service and furnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
interpreters, guides, and laborers. The Professors, as
they were called, constituted an itinerant academy.
They drafted their own instructions, and no superior
authority took upon itself to make these subservient to
the interests of the expedition as a whole. From February,
1734, they held one or two weekly meetings and
passed independent resolutions. It became a part of
Bering's task to move this cumbersome machine, this
learned republic, from St. Petersburg to Kamchatka, to
care for their comforts and conveniences, and render possible
the flank movements and side sallies that either
scientific demands or their own freaks of will might dictate.
In the original instructions such directions were
by no means few. But Bering had no authority over
these men. They were willing to recognize his authority
only when they needed his assistance. None of them
except Bering and his former associates had any idea of
the mode and conditions of travel in that barbarous
country. That there should be lack of understanding
between men with such different objects in view as
academists and naval officers, is not very strange. Their
only bond of union was the Senate's senseless ukase. If
it had been the purpose of the government to exhibit a
human parallel to the "happy families" of menageries, it
could hardly have acted differently. In all his movements
Bering was hampered by this academical deadweight.
The Professors not only showed a lack of appreciation
of Bering's efforts in their behalf, but they also
stormed him with complaints, filled their records with
them, and concluded them&mdash;characteristically enough&mdash;with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
a resolution to prefer formal charges against him
before the Senate.</p>

<p>Only a new state, as the Russian then was, only a
government that recently had seen the will of one energetic
man turn topsy-turvy a whole people's mode of life,
and yet had preserved a fanciful faith in Peter the Great's
teachings&mdash;his supreme disregard for obstacles,&mdash;only
such a government could even think of heaping such
mountains of enterprises one upon the other, or demand
that any one man, and a foreigner at that, should carry
them into execution. Peter's spirit undoubtedly hovered
over these plans, but the marble sarcophagus in the
church of St. Peter and St. Paul had long since received
his earthly remains, and without his personal energy the
Senate's plans were but the projects of a dazzled fancy.
On paper the Senate might indeed refer Bering to
various ways and means; it might enjoin upon the
Siberian authorities to do everything in their power to
promote the progress of the various expeditions; it might
direct its secretaries to prepare a very humane declamation
denouncing the practice of any violence against, or
oppression of, the weak nomadic tribes in the East; but
it could not by a few pen-strokes increase the natural
resources of Siberia, or change the unwillingness of the
local authorities to accede to the inordinate demands
which the nautical expedition necessarily had to make,
nor could it make roads in the wild forest-regions where
only the Yakut and Tunguse roamed about. The Senate's
humanitarian phrases were of but little significance
to the explorers when it was found necessary to compel
the nomads of the East to supply what the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
had failed to furnish. The Senate had ventured so near
the extreme limits of the possible, that it could not but
end by crossing the border and demanding the impossible.
These numerous expeditions, scattered over half a continent,
were exposed to so many unforeseeable accidents
and misfortunes, that the government, in order to render
support and retain its control, would necessarily have to
be in regular communication. But east of Moscow there
was no mail service. Hence the government instructed
Bering to establish, on consultation with the local authorities,
postal communication, partly monthly and partly
bi-monthly, from Moscow to Kamchatka, to the Chinese
border by way of Irkutsk, and by a new route to Uda,&mdash;as
though such a matter could be accomplished through
consultation. The Senate might have known, and in
fact did know, that in the mountainous forest-region
between Yakutsk and Okhotsk (a distance of about seven
hundred miles) there was but one single Russian hut,
and that all the requisites for a mail service&mdash;men,
horses, and roads&mdash;demanded unlimited means and most
extensive preparations.</p>

<p>A number of plans and propositions of minor importance
are here omitted. The object has been to show, in
a succinct review, the origin of the Great Northern Expedition,
its enormous compass, and the grouping of its
various enterprises about Vitus Bering as its chief. Von
Baer classes the tasks to be accomplished by Bering, each
of which demanded separately equipped expeditions,
under seven heads: namely, astronomical observations
and determinations in Siberia, physico-geographical explorations,
historic-ethnographical studies, the charting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of the Arctic coast, the navigation of the East Siberian
coast, and the discovery of Japan and America. This
writer adds that no other geographical enterprise, not
even the charting of China by the Jesuits, Mackenzie's
travels, or Franklin's expeditions, can in greatness or
sacrifice be compared with the gigantic undertakings that
were loaded upon Bering, and carried out by him.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>It would no doubt be wrong to ascribe the over-burdening
of Bering's plans to any one man, and for a
foreign author, who but imperfectly understands the
Russian literature of that period, to do so, would be more
than foolish. Kiriloff, the secretary of the Senate, had
great zeal for geographical explorations, and did all in
his power to further the plans of Czar Peter. It has been
proved that Bering's proposition was presented after a
conference with Kiriloff, and that as long as he lived, he
assisted Bering by word and deed. Furthermore, it
seems probable that, in order to promote the exploration
of Siberia, he prevented the Admiralty from sending
Bering's expedition by sea south of Africa. However, it
is undoubtedly a fact that Bering's plan reached its final
proportions as a result of the discussions between Count
Ostermann, the influential courtier and statesman, (who
evidently landed in Russia in company with Bering in
1701), Soimonoff, an officer of the Senate, Kiriloff, and
Golovin, chief of the Admiralty, and these men would
hardly have consulted the opinions of Bering, who often
and most emphatically disapproved of the additions that
had been made to his plans. Moreover, as a result of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>distrust which his first expedition inspired in Russia, he
was in an insecure and unfortunate position. But he
had reason to complain of other things. The gigantic
task assigned to him demanded a despotic will endowed
with dictatorial power. Bering lacked both, especially
the latter.</p>

<p>The Senate exhausted itself in minute hints, directions,
and propositions, instead of issuing definite orders
concerning the necessary means. Unfortunately, too,
numerous and exaggerated complaints had been made in
regard to the suffering which Bering's first expedition
had caused the Kamchatkans, and on this account the
government was foolish enough to bind the chief's hands,
while it simultaneously overloaded his shoulders.
Through injudicious instructions he was made dependent
upon his subordinates. It was bad enough that he was
not to be permitted to take any decisive steps in Siberia
without first consulting and coming to an agreement with
the local authorities,&mdash;the governor of Tobolsk, the lieutenant-governor
of Irkutsk, and the voivode of Yakutsk.
On account of the great distances and the wretched
roads such proceedings were well-nigh impossible. The
government should have known that these authorities
only under the most peremptory orders would comply
with demands liable to exhaust the resources of the
country and ruin the thinly-populated and poverty-stricken
districts. This was, indeed, bad enough, but
matters were much aggravated when the Senate ordered
him to take action in all important questions, only after
deliberation with his officers, and to refer every loading
measure to a commission. Such a method of procedure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
seems to us entirely incomprehensible. But Sokoloff,
who was himself a Russian naval officer, says on this
point, that the laws of the empire, which at that time
were in full force, required of every superior officer that
he should consult his subordinates before inaugurating
any new movement. In its instructions to Bering the
Senate expressly emphasized this decree of the law, and
it actually went so far as to order him, even in matters of
comparative unimportance, to seek the opinion of his
Academical associates, and always act in the strictest
accordance with his Russian colleague Chirikoff's propositions.</p>

<p>The chiefs of the different branches of the expedition
were of course subject to the same regulation. In this
way Bering was deprived of a sovereign chief's power and
authority, and it afforded him but little reparation that
the government gave him the power to reduce or promote
an officer,&mdash;only naval officers, however. Necessary regard
for the needs of the service and for his own principles
forbade him to use this weapon in that arbitrary
manner which alone could have neutralized the unfortunate
influence of the government laws. Hence this
feature of his instructions, besides causing much delay,
became a source of the most incredible troubles and
aggravations, which, as we shall see later, laid him in his
grave on the bleak coasts of Bering Island.</p>

<p>Everything carefully considered, it could have surprised
no one if the Northern Expedition had collapsed
in its very greatness, and it was without any doubt due to
Bering that this did not happen. In many respects
Bering was unqualified to lead such an expedition into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
barbarous country, surrounded as he was with incapable,
uneducated, and corruptible assistants, pestered by calumniators
and secret or avowed enemies in every quarter, to
whom the government seemed more disposed to listen
than to him. More just than arbitrary, more considerate
than hasty, more humane than his position permitted, he
nevertheless had one important quality, an honest,
genuine, and tenacious spirit of perseverance, and this
saved the expedition from dissolution. The government
had sent him in pursuit of a golden chariot, and he
found more than the linchpin. The realization, however,
was far from that anticipated by the government.
Many of the projects of the original plan were but
partially accomplished, and others were not even attempted;
but in spite of this, the results attained by
Bering and his associates will stand as boundary-posts
in the history of geographical discovery. Many of these
men sealed their work with their lives, and added a
luster to the name of Russia,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> which later explorers have
maintained.</p>

THE GREAT NORTHERN EXPEDITION ON ITS WAY
THROUGH SIBERIA.&mdash;DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS
ENCOUNTERED AND OVERCOME.</h3>


<p>In the early part of the year 1733, the expedition
began to leave St. Petersburg by detachments. It
consisted of the chief Vitus Bering (his Russian name
was Ivan Ivanovich Bering), Captains Spangberg and
Chirikoff, eight lieutenants, sixteen mates, twelve physicians,
seven priests, skippers, stewards, various apprentices,
ship-carpenters, other workmen, soldiers and
sailors,&mdash;in all about five hundred and seventy men. Of
these, three officers and one hundred and fifty-seven men&mdash;a
number which was greatly increased in Siberia&mdash;were
assigned duty in the Arctic expedition, the remainder
in the Pacific expeditions. In this estimate, the
Academists, constituting an expedition of thirty or forty
men, are not considered. The list of names of those
engaged in these expeditions throws interesting light on
Russian social relations of that period. Over half of the
officers, many mates, and all of the physicians were
foreigners. The Senate sought to inspire the zeal of the
officers by large increase of salary and promotion in rank
and service after a successfully completed expedition, but
the rank and file were to be forced to a performance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
their duties by threats of cruel punishments and a continued
stay in Siberia. It had been the intention to
recruit the expedition through the voluntary service of
Russians, but the native officers showed but little inclination
in this direction, and it was found necessary to fill
the vacancies by draft. Van Haven assures us that
Bering's expedition was looked upon in St. Petersburg as
a mild sort of banishment.</p>

<p>The necessary instruments and some provisions were
obtained in St. Petersburg. The naval officers were supplied
with quadrants, thermometers, and nocturnals, the
surveyors with astrolabes and Gunter's-chains, and the
Academists were authorized to take from the library of
the Academy all the works they needed, and, at the
expense of the crown, to purchase such as the library did
not contain. La Croy&egrave;re carried with him a whole
magazine of instruments. For presents to the natives
two thousand rubles were appropriated. In N. Novgorod
and Kazan some other necessaries were obtained, but
the enormous ship-supplies and provisions, besides men,
horses, barges and other river boats, were to be provided
by the Siberian towns and country districts.</p>

<p>The Siberian authorities received orders to make great
preparations. They were to buy venison, fish, and cod
liver oil, erect light-houses and magazines along the
Arctic coast, and dispatch commissions with large transports
to the Pacific coast, so as to enable Bering to begin
his work of discovery without delay. These preparations
were to be followed by efforts toward the founding of
various works, such as iron and salt works at Okhotsk, a
smaller furnace at Yakutsk for the use of the expedition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and, through the utilization of the saccharine qualities
of the "bear's claw,"<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> a distillery was also to be
established on the peninsula of Kamchatka. It is
unnecessary to say that all of these propositions were
buried in the Siberian government departments.</p>

<p>Calculations were made for a six years' expedition.
The leaders of each branch of the expedition were
authorized to repeat any unsuccessful adventure the
succeeding summer. All were prepared for a long
stay in the extreme northeast&mdash;many, indeed, remained
there forever&mdash;hence, most of the officers,
among them Bering and Spangberg, were accompanied
by their wives and children. On this account
the expedition seemed more than ever a national
migration on a small scale.</p>

<p>The first start was made February 1, 1733.
Spangberg, with some laborers and the heaviest marine
stores, went directly to Okhotsk to expedite the
ship-building on the Pacific coast. Lieutenant Ofzyn
went to Kazan to collect supplies. Bering started
out March 18, in order as quickly as possible to
reach Tobolsk, whence the first Arctic expedition was
to be sent out. In the course of the summer, the
larger caravans arrived at this place. Simultaneously
heavy supplies were brought in from West Siberia by
Bering's men. Here, also, the construction of the
vessel for the expedition, the shallop Tobol, was
begun. Only the Academists were yet in St. Petersburg,
where they were receiving the attention of the
official world. At an audience, the Empress bade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>them farewell in the most solemn manner. She allowed
them to kiss her hand, and assured them of
her most gracious favor. On the succeeding day, the
other members of the imperial family manifested similar
sympathy. Then, however, the difficulties began.
That these heavily-laden gentlemen could not even in
St. Petersburg secure adequate means of transportation,
makes quite a comical impression. On this account
they were detained until late in August, and they
would no doubt have been unable to reach Siberia
in 1733, if Bering had not left for them in Tver a
conveniently equipped vessel, which carried them the
same autumn down the Volga to Kazan. They did
not reach Tobolsk, however, until January, 1734.
Bering, who was to be supplied by them with surveyors
and instruments for his Arctic expedition, and
who could not, before their arrival, form an estimate
of the size of his river transports to be used in the
spring, was obliged repeatedly and very forcibly to
urge them to make haste. Here the disagreements
began, and were continued concerning petty affairs,
which history finds it unnecessary to dwell upon.</p>

<p>On May 2, 1734, the Tobol was launched amid the
firing of cannon, the blare of trumpets, and the merry
draining of goblets. The vessel had a keel of 70 feet,
was 15 feet wide, and 7 feet deep. It carried two masts,
some small cannon, and a crew of 56 men, among
them first mate Sterlegoff and two cartographers,
under the command of Lieut. Ofzyn. As the provincial
government had secured neither magazines nor provisions,
nor attended to any other preparations on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Arctic coast, the necessary supplies, which were to be
stored north of Obdorsk, were loaded on four rafts,
which, with a force of 30 men, accompanied Ofzyn.
On May 14, he received his Admiralty instructions from
Bering, and, saluted by cannon, the <i>First Arctic Expedition</i>
stood up the Irtish for the Polar seas.</p>

<p>Five days later, Bering, with the main command
and the Academists, left Tobolsk and took different
routes for Yakutsk, which had been selected as the
central point for the future enterprises of the expedition.
In October, 1734, he arrived at this place, bringing
with him a quantity of materials. The next spring,
Chirikoff came with the greater part of the supplies,
and during the year following, this dull Siberian city
was the scene of no little activity. On his arrival,
however, Bering found that no preparations whatever
had been made for him. In spite of instructions and
orders from the government, nothing had been done
toward charting the Arctic coast or for the expediting
of the heavily loaded transports on the way to
Okhotsk. Nor did Bering find that the authorities
were even kindly disposed toward him. Yet, in the
course of the next six months, he had two large ships
built for the Arctic expedition, and when his own supplies
arrived by way of the central Siberian river-route,
described in the first part of this work, these
vessels, together with four barges, were equipped and
furnished with provisions, and in June, 1735, were
ready for a start. These two ships&mdash;the sloop Yakutsk,
Lieut. Pronchisheff, first mate Chelyuskin, surveyor Chekin,
and about fifty men, and the decked boat Irkutsk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Lieut. Peter Lassenius, with a surveyor, first mate,
and also about fifty men&mdash;had most difficult tasks to
accomplish. The former was to cruise from the mouth
of the Lena, along the whole coast of the Taimyr
peninsula, and enter the mouth of the Yenisei. The
latter was to follow the Arctic coast in an easterly
direction to the Bering peninsula, cruise along its coast,
and ascertain the relative positions of Asia and America,
and, if it was a geographical possibility, to sail
down to the peninsula of Kamchatka. He also had
instructions to find the islands off the mouth of the
Kolyma (the Bear Islands). From this it is evident
that Lassenius's expedition was of the greater geographical
interest. Moreover, it had to do with one of
the main questions of Bering's whole activity&mdash;the discovery
and charting of the North Pacific&mdash;and hence
it is not a mere accident that Bering selected for this
expedition one of his own countrymen, or that he assigned
the charting of northeastern Asia and the discovery
of America and Japan, to chiefs of Danish birth, Lassenius
and Spangberg. Nothing is known of the earlier
life of Lassenius. In service he was the oldest of
Bering's lieutenants. Shortly before the departure
of the expedition, he was taken into the Russian fleet,
and Gmelin says of him, that he was an able and
experienced naval officer, volunteered his services to the
expedition, and began his work with intrepidity. All
attempts to trace his birth and family relations have
proved fruitless.</p>

<p>On the 30th of June, 1735, both expeditions left
Yakutsk, and thus the charting of the whole of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Arctic coast of Siberia was planned and inaugurated
by Bering himself. He could now apply all his energies
to the Pacific expeditions. He constructed a multitude
of river-craft, and erected barracks, magazines,
winter-huts, and wharves along the river-route to
Okhotsk. In the vicinity of Yakutsk he established an
iron foundry and furnace, whence the various vessels
were supplied with anchors and other articles of iron.
In fact, he made this place the emporium for those
heavy supplies that in the years 1735-36 were brought
from South and West Siberia, and which later were to
be sent to Okhotsk.</p>

<p>At Okhotsk the exiled Major-General Pissarjeff was
in command. He had been sent there as a government
official, with authority on the Pacific coast and
in Kamchatka, to develop the country and pave the
way for the expeditions to follow, by making roads
and harbors, erecting buildings in Okhotsk, introducing
agriculture,&mdash;in fact, make this coast fit for human
habitation. The government had given him ample
power, but as he accomplished nothing, he was succeeded
by Captain Pavlutski as chief in Kamchatka,
and Pissarjeff was reduced to a sort of harbor-master
in Okhotsk. A command that had been sent to his
assistance under first mate Bireff, he nearly starved to
death; the men deserted and the town remained the same
rookery as ever.</p>

<p>In this condition Spangberg found affairs in the
winter of 1734-35. With his usual energy he had
pushed his transports to Yakutsk in the summer preceding,
and with the same boats he proceeded up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Aldan and Maya, but winter came on and his boats
were frozen in on the Yudoma. He started out on foot
by the familiar route across the Stanovoi Mountains to
Okhotsk, which place he reached after enduring great
hardship and suffering; but even here he found no
roof for shelter. He was forced to subsist on carcasses
and roots, and not until the spring fishing
began and a provision caravan sent by Bering arrived,
did he escape this dire distress. In the early
summer, Pissarjeff put in an appearance, and very
soon a bitter and fatal enmity arose between these
two men.</p>

<p>Spangberg was born in Jerne near Esbjerg in Jutland
(Denmark), probably about the year 1698. He
was the son of well-to-do parents of the middle
class. In the Jerne churchyard there is still to be seen
a beautiful monument on the grave of his brother,
the "estimable and well-born Chr. Spangberg,"
nothing else is known of his early life. In 1720, he
entered the Russian fleet as a lieutenant of the fourth
rank, and for a time ran the packet-boat between
Kronstadt and L&uuml;beck, whereupon he took part in
Bering's first expedition as second in command. In
1732, for meritorious service on this expedition, he
was made a captain of the third rank. He was an
able, shrewd, and energetic man, a practical seaman,
active and vehement, inconsiderate of the feelings of
others, tyrannical and avaricious. He spoke the Russian
language only imperfectly. His fame preceded
him throughout all Siberia, and Sokoloff says that many
thought him some general, <i>incognito</i>, others an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
escaped convict. The natives of Siberia feared him
and called him Martin Petrovich Kosar, or in ironical
praise, "Batushka" (old fellow). He had many
enemies. Complaints and accusations were showered
upon him, but it would most certainly be wrong to
ascribe to them any great significance. Siberia is the
land of slander. All Russian officials were corruptible,
and the honest men among those who stood
nearest to Peter himself could literally be counted
on one's fingers. While in Siberia, Spangberg is
said to have acquired the possession of many horses,
valuable furs, and other goods of which the authorities
had forced the sale. When the Senate, after
his great voyage of discovery to Japan, had treated
him unjustly, he left Siberia arbitrarily in 1745,
and, without leave of absence, set out for St. Petersburg,
where he was summoned before a court-martial
and condemned to death; but this was finally
commuted to his being reduced to a lieutenant for
three months. He remained in the service and died,
in 1761, as a captain of the first rank. In Okhotsk
he was accompanied by his wife and son.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>But his opponent was a still more remarkable
man. Major-General Pissarjeff had been a favorite of
Peter the Great, director of the military academy,
and a high officer of the Senate. He had received a
careful education abroad, and moved in the very
highest circles of society. In a quarrel with Vice-Chancellor
Shafiroff, in 1722, however, he had incurred
Peter's wrath, whereupon he was for a time deprived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>of all official rank and banished to the Ladoga canal
as overseer of this great enterprise. Later he was
pardoned, but when, in 1727, he conspired against
Prince Menshikoff, he was deprived of everything,
knouted, branded, and then exiled to Siberia as a
colonist. After a series of vicissitudes he appeared,
in the capacity of harbor-master at Okhotsk, but the
government gave him no rank; he was not even permitted
to cover his brand. This old man, made
vicious by a long and unjust banishment, became
Bering's evil spirit. In spite of his sixty or seventy
years, he was as restless, fiery and vehement in both
speech and action as when a youth, dissolute, corruptible,
and slanderous&mdash;a false and malicious babbler,
a full-fledged representative of the famous Siberian
"school for scandal." For six long years he
persecuted the expedition with his hatred and falsehoods,
and was several times within an ace of overthrowing
everything. He lived in a stockaded fort a few
miles in the country, while Spangberg's quarters were
down by the sea, on the so-called Kushka, a strip
of land in the Okhota delta, where the town was to
be founded. The power of each was unrestrained.
Both were dare-devils who demanded an obedience
which foretold the speedy overthrow of each. Both
sought to maintain their authority through imprisonment
and corporal punishment. Thus they wrangled
for a year, Pissarjeff, meanwhile, sending numerous
complaints to Yakutsk and St. Petersburg. But
Spangberg was not to be trifled with. In the fall
of 1736 he swore that he would effectually rid himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of "the old scoundrel," who thereupon in all haste
fled to Yakutsk, where he arrived after a nine days'
ride, and filled the town with his prattling falsehoods,
to which, however, only the Academists seem to have
paid any attention.</p>

<p>Under circumstances where the local authorities did
everything in their power to hinder the development
of a district, it is only natural that in the settlement of
Okhotsk and the construction of the ships for the expedition
but slow progress was made. The enormous
stores which were necessary for six or eight sea-going
ships&mdash;provisions, cannon, powder, cables, hemp, canvas,
etc., it would take two or three years to bring from
Yakutsk, a distance both long and tedious, and fraught
with danger. The work, the superhuman efforts, the
forethought, and perseverance that Bering and his
men exhibited on these transporting expeditions on the
rivers of East Siberia have never been described or
understood, and yet they perhaps form the climax in
the events of this expedition, every page of the history
of which tells of suffering and thankless toil.</p>

<p>In the middle of the 17th century, those Cossacks
that conquered the Amoor country had opened this
river navigation, and now Bering re-opened it. The
stores were transported down the Lena, up the Aldan,
Maya, and Yudoma rivers, thence across the Stanovoi
Mountains, down the Urak, and by sea to Okhotsk.
These transportations at first employed five hundred
soldiers and exiles, and later more than a thousand.
The season is very short. The rivers break up in the
early part of May, when the spring floods, full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
devastating drift-ice, rise twenty or thirty feet above
the average level and sweep along in their course
whole islands, thus filling the river-bed with trunks
of trees and sand, deluging the wild rock-encircled
valleys, so that navigation can not begin until the latter
part of May, again to be obstructed in August by
ice. The course was against the current, so the crew
had to walk along the rough and slippery banks and
tug the flat-bottomed barges up stream. In this way
they were usually able, during the first summer, to
reach the junction of the Maya and the Aldan (Ust
Maiskaya), where Bering built a pier and a number
of magazines, barracks, and winter-huts. Then the
next summer, the journey would be continued up the
Maya and into the Yudoma, which boils along through
an open mountain valley over rocks, stones, and water-logged
tree trunks. It has but two or three feet of
water, is full of sand-banks, with a waterfall here and
there and long rapids and eddies,&mdash;the so-called
"schiver." In such places the current was so strong
that thirty men were scarcely able to tug a boat
against it. Standing in water to their waists, the men
were, so to speak, obliged to carry the barges. The
water was very cauterizing, and covered their legs
and feet with boils and sores. The oppressive heat of
the day was followed by nights that were biting cold,
and when new ice was formed, their sufferings were
superhuman. In this manner Yudomskaya Krest
(Yudoma's Cross) was reached in August of the second
year. This place, where since the days of the Cossack
expedition a cross had stood, Bering made an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
intermediate station for the expedition. Here were the
dwellings of two officers, a barrack, two earth-huts, six
warehouses, and a few other buildings and winter-huts.
In these warehouses the goods were stored,
to be conveyed, in the following winter, on horseback
across the Stanovoi Mountains to the mountain stream
Urak, which, after a course of two hundred versts,
reaches the sea three miles south of Okhotsk.</p>

<p>For this part of the expedition, new winter-huts on
the Stanovoi Mountains, and magazines, river boats,
and piers on the Urak had to be built. This river is
navigable only for a few days after the spring thaw.
Then it boils along at the rate of six miles an hour,
often making a trip down its course a dangerous one.
Losseff says that in this way, other things being favorable,
Okhotsk was reached in three years. The brief
account which has here been attempted gives but a
faint idea of the labor, perseverance, and endurance
requisite to make one of these expeditions. Barges
and boats had to be built at three different places,
roads had to be made along rivers, over mountains,
and through forests, and piers, bridges, storehouses,
winter-huts and dwellings had to be constructed at
these various places. Not only this. They suffered
many misfortunes. Boats and barges were lost, men
and beasts of burden were drowned, deserted, or were
torn to pieces by wolves,&mdash;and all these difficulties
Bering and his assistants overcame through their own
activity, without the support of the Siberian government,
yes, in spite of its ill will, both concealed and
manifest. In 1737, he reported to the Admiralty:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
"Prior to our arrival at Yakutsk not a pood<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> of provisions
had been brought to Okhotsk for us, nor had
a single boat been built for the transportation. Nor
did we find workmen or magazines at the landing
places on the Maya and Yudoma rivers. The Siberian
authorities have not taken a single step toward complying
with the ukases issued by Her Royal Highness."
And with justifiable self-esteem he adds: "We did
all this. We built transports, we obtained workmen
in Yakutsk, we conveyed our provisions to Yudomskaya
Krest, and with superhuman efforts thence to
the sea. At the mouths of the Maya and Yudoma,
at the Cross, and at the Urak we erected storehouses
and dwellings, in the Stanovoi Mountains several winter-huts,
and on the Urak no less than seventy river
boats, which have, in part, started for Okhotsk with
provisions. Not until after the lapse of two years
have I been able to induce the authorities in Yakutsk
to appoint superintendents of transportation, and for
this reason it was entirely impossible for me to depart
for Okhotsk, unless I wanted to see the work of the
whole expedition come to a complete standstill, bring
upon my men the direst need, and force the whole
enterprise into most ignominious ruin."</p>

DELAY OF THE EXPEDITION CAUSED BY THE DEATH
OF LASSENIUS AND HIS COMMAND IN THE ARCTIC
REGIONS.&mdash;DISSATISFACTION OF THE SENATE AND
ADMIRALTY WITH BERING'S WORK.</h3>


<p>The difficulties recounted in the preceding chapter
are alone sufficient to justify Bering's nearly three
years' stay in Yakutsk; but simultaneously many other
duties demanded his attention. It does not come within
the scope of this treatise to describe the investigations of
the Academical branch of this enterprise,&mdash;to portray
M&uuml;ller's and Gmelin's services to botany, history, and
geography; they are of interest here only in their relation
to Bering. Especially in Yakutsk did those men give
him much to attend to. It devolved upon him now to
convey those gentlemen, in a manner fitting their station,
up or down the Lena, now to send La Croy&egrave;re to Lake
Baikal or to the Arctic Ocean,&mdash;all of which was to be
done in a country principally inhabited by nomadic
tribes, with only here and there a Russian population
where there were government officials, and with no other
means of transportation than those secured for the occasion.
In Yakutsk, where the Professors stayed a long
time, their relations with Bering were very much
strained, principally, it would seem, on account of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
exorbitant demands for convenience and luxury. Since
Bering would not and could not take upon himself to
transport them to Kamchatka as comfortably as he had
thus far conveyed them, especially not from Okhotsk, in
private and conveniently equipped vessels, and since the
Voivode likewise gave them but little hope of support,
both Gmelin and M&uuml;ller made application for a release
from the expedition, and left to Krasheninnikoff and
Steller their principal task&mdash;the description of Kamchatka.</p>

<p>In the year 1736, moreover, very discouraging news was
received from the Arctic seas. Pronchisheff had been
obliged to go into winter quarters at Olenek, and Lassenius,
who, August 2, had reached the rocky islet Stolb, in
the Lena delta, and on the 7th stood out of the mouth of
the Bykoff eastward, was driven by storm and ice into the
river Khariulakh, east of the Borkhaya Bay, where he
wintered, in a latitude of 71&deg; 28'. The place was uninhabited,
and he built from driftwood a winter-house 66 feet
long, making four apartments, with three fireplaces, and
a separate kitchen and bath-room. As Lassenius hoped
to be able to continue the expedition during the two
succeeding summers, the rations were made considerably
smaller.</p>

<p>November 6, the polar night began, and shortly afterwards
nearly the whole crew were attacked by a deadly
scurvy, so violent that perhaps only Jens Munk<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and his
fellow-sufferers on the Churchill River have experienced
anything worse. On the 19th of December Lassenius
died, and in the few succeeding months nearly all of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>officers and thirty-one of the crew, so that when assistance
from Bering arrived, only eight men were alive. M&uuml;ller
and Gmelin say that the crew accused Lassenius of high
treason, and mutinied; but there is no documentary evidence
of this. The report seems to have arisen through
a confounding of the name of Lassenius with that of the
deputy constable Rosselius, who, on the 18th of November,
1735, was sent, under arrest, to Yakutsk. To fill
the vacancies caused by this terrible disease, Bering had to
send a whole new command&mdash;Lieut. Dmitri Laptjef, the
second mate Plauting, and forty-three men&mdash;to Khariulakh
to continue the expedition. In addition to this,
two boats with provisions were sent to the mouth of the
Lena, and in 1737, before he himself departed for
Okhotsk, a shipload of provisions was sent to supply the
magazines on the Arctic coast. To these various tasks
Bering gave his personal attention.</p>

<p>In 1736-38 this great enterprise passed through a dangerous
crisis. Several years had elapsed since the departure
from St. Petersburg, three hundred thousand rubles
(over two hundred thousand dollars) had been expended&mdash;an
enormous sum at that time&mdash;and yet Bering could
not point to a single result. Lassenius was dead, his successor,
D. Laptjef, had been unfortunate, Pronchisheff
had, in two summers of cruising, not been able to double
the Taimyr peninsula, Ofzyn was struggling in vain in
the Gulf of Obi, while Bering and Spangberg had not
begun their Pacific expeditions. The former had not
even reached the coast. The government authorities at
St. Petersburg were in the highest degree dissatisfied with
this seeming dilatoriness. The Senate sent a most earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
appeal to the Admiralty to recall the expedition. Here
was a situation that Bering's enemies thought favorable
for their intrigues. The departments of the Admiralty
were deluged with complaints and accusations. The
Siberian authorities, of whom Bering so justly had complained,
answered with counter-charges. He was not familiar
with the country, they said; he made unreasonable
demands, and did not know how to avail himself of means
at hand. Pissarjeff told the government that Bering and
Spangberg had undertaken this expedition into Siberia
simply to fill their own pockets,&mdash;that they accepted
bribes, carried on a contraband liquor traffic, and had
already accumulated great wealth. The exiled naval
officer, Kasanssoff, reported that there was entire lack of
system in the enterprise; that everything was done at an
enormous expenditure, and that nothing at all would be
accomplished. Lieutenant Plauting, one of Bering's own
officers, who had been reduced for neglect of duty, accused
Bering of being arbitrary, extravagant, and fond of show
at the expense of the government. He accused him, furthermore,
of embezzlement on his first expedition, in
1725, and alleged that Bering's wife had returned to
Russia with a fortune, and had in Yakutsk abducted two
young women.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>History has not confirmed a single one of these charges.
As for sacrifice, disinterestedness, and zeal, Bering not
only rises far above his surroundings&mdash;which is, perhaps,
not saying very much&mdash;but his character is clean and
unsullied. Even so petty a person as Sokoloff, who, in
other respects, does not spare him, has for his character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>unqualified praise. Nevertheless, all of these complaints
and accusations caused Bering much trouble and vexation.
The Admiralty, hard pressed by the Senate, found it difficult
to furnish the necessary means for the continuation
of the expedition, and treated Bering severely and unreasonably.
It lacked the view which personal examination
gives. It was beset with deceitfulness and circumvention,
and its experiences led it to take the worst for granted.
Hence, it sent Bering one message after the other reprehensive
of his course. It threatened to fine him, to
court-martial him, to reduce him, and, in 1737, it even
went so far as to deprive him of his supplemental salary,
which was withheld several years.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Bering defended himself
with the bitterness of despair. In his reports he gave
the most solemn assurances of his perseverance and fidelity
to duty, and the most detailed accounts of all difficulties.
He declared upon his honor that he was unable to see any
other means or resources than those he had resorted to. He
even appealed at last to the testimony of the chiefs of the
various expeditions and all the subordinate officers. He
was not believed. The Admiralty showed its lack of tact
by letting Chirikoff investigate a series of charges against
him. Furthermore, in spite of Bering's most urgent representations,
Pissarjeff continued to retain his position in
Okhotsk; and, although the government threatened the
Siberian authorities with the sternest punishments, still
the latter only very inactively participated in the work of
the expedition.</p>

<p>Sokoloff gives a very repulsive picture of Bering's
assistants. On account of the discomforts of the journey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>in this barbaric country, and under the pressure of ceaseless
toil, a large number of the subordinates fell to drinking
and committing petty thefts; and the officers, gathered
as they were from all quarters of the world, are
described as a band of gruff and unruly brawlers. They
were always at sword's points. Pronchisheff and Lassenius,
Chirikoff and Spangberg, the latter and Walton,
Plauting, Waxel, Petroff and Endoguroff, were constantly
wrangling, and at times most shameful scenes were
enacted. Our Russian author is not adverse to giving
Bering the principal blame for these dissensions which
cast a gloom on this worthy undertaking and impaired
the forces of the expedition. He repeatedly, and with
much force, accuses him of being weak, and in the Imperial
Marine this opinion seems yet to prevail.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Sokoloff
says: "Bering was a well-informed man, eager for knowledge,
pious, kind-hearted, and honest, but altogether too
cautious and indecisive; zealous, persevering, and yet not
sufficiently energetic; well liked by his subordinates, yet
without sufficient influence over them,&mdash;too much
inclined to allow himself to be affected by their opinions
and desires, and not able to maintain strict discipline.
Hence, he was not particularly well qualified to lead this
great enterprise, especially in such a dark century and
in such a barbaric country as East Siberia." I do not
doubt that we here find some of the elements of Bering's
character, but Sokoloff was much more of an archivist
than historian and student of human nature. In his long
accounts he never succeeds, by means of describing any
action or situation, in giving a psychological insight into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>Bering's character, and, as matters now stand, it is impossible
to draw any tenable line between the errors and
delays that were necessarily attendant upon such an over-burdened
enterprise, and those that were due to the possible
inefficiency of the leader. By the authority of the
Senate the expedition was not a monarchical unit under
Bering, but a democratic association under an administrative
chief. It is not difficult to collect from the literature
of that day a series of expressions which accuse Bering of
cruelty, imperiousness, and military arrogance. Of a hundred
leaders in Bering's position ninety-nine would
undoubtedly have thought it wise to leave the whole expedition.
Steller has with far more delicacy and skill drawn
the main lines of his mental physiognomy. "Bering
was," he says, "a true and honest Christian, noble, kind,
and unassuming in conduct, universally loved by his subordinates,
high as well as low. Every reasonable person
must admit that he always sought to perform the work
entrusted to him to the best of his ability, although he
himself confessed and often regretted that his strength
was no longer sufficient for so difficult an expedition.
He deplored the fact that the plans for the expedition had
been made on a much larger and more extensive scale than
he had proposed, and he expressed a desire that, on account
of his age, he might be released from this duty and have
the task assigned to some young and active Russian. As
is well known, he was not naturally a man of quick
resolve, but when one considers his fidelity to duty, his
cheerful spirit of perseverance and careful deliberation, it
is a question whether another, possessed of more fire and
ardor, could have overcome the innumerable difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of the expedition without having completely ruined those
distant regions; for even Bering, far removed from all
selfishness, was scarcely able in this regard to keep his
men in check. The only fault of which the brave man
can be accused, is that his too great leniency was as detrimental
as the spirited and oftentimes inconsiderate conduct
of his subordinates." It is undoubtedly true that
Bering was not fully equal to the task; but no one would
have been equal to this task. It is possible that his
humane conduct impaired the work of the expedition, but
this allegation still lacks proof, and Sokoloff, who wrote
his book as a vindication of Chirikoff against Von Baer's
sympathetic view of Bering, must be read with this reservation.
It is downright absurd to hold the leader responsible
for the moral weaknesses of his officers, for he had
not chosen them, and was as dependent upon them as
they upon him. "It seems to me," says Von Baer,
"that Bering has everywhere acted with the greatest circumspection
and energy, and also with the greatest forbearance.
The whole expedition was planned on such a
monstrous scale that under many another chief it would
have foundered without having accomplished any results
whatever."</p>

FINAL PREPARATIONS FOR THE PACIFIC EXPEDITIONS.</h3>


<p>In the summer of 1737, Bering changed his headquarters
to Okhotsk, and in the course of the
autumn and winter, the greater part of his force was
transferred to the same place or distributed among the
various intermediate stations on the Yudoma, Maya,
and Urak. Spangberg and Bering built Okhotsk. At
the junction of the Okhota and the Kukhta, on one of
the narrow deltas, the so-called Kushka, they erected
a church for the expedition, a number of houses for
the officers, barracks, magazines, a large dock-yard,
and other buildings. The old stockaded fort, four
miles farther up in the country, was deserted. Around
the military center of the expedition the town gradually
formed and rapidly grew to become the Russian
metropolis on the Pacific. It cost very great exertions
to make the place inhabitable. The site was a
long sand-bank deposit, threatened by inundations.
The climate was very unhealthy,&mdash;a cold, raw fog
almost continually hung over this region. The party
was pestered with fevers, and in this swamp it was
that Bering lost his health. "The place is new and
desolate," he writes. "We have sand and pebbles, no
vegetation whatever, and no timber in the vicinity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Firewood must be obtained at a distance of four to
five miles, drinking water one to two miles, while
timber and joints for ship-building must be floated
down the river twenty-five miles." But as a place for
a dock-yard, as a harbor and haven of refuge for large
ships, the location had such great advantages that these
difficulties had to be overcome.</p>

<p>Spangberg's work had made the place. His men
had worked clay, made tiles, and built houses, and
when Bering arrived the ships Archangel Michael and
Hope lay fully equipped in the harbor. Bering's
old ships Fortuna and Gabriel had been repaired,
and Spangberg lacked only an adequate supply of
provisions to begin his expedition to Japan in the
autumn of 1737.</p>

<p>But the provision transports, as usual, moved on
very slowly and with great difficulty. In Okhotsk
Spangberg's men were constantly in distress. They
received only the rations of flour and rice authorized
by law, and at long intervals some beef which Bering
had bought in Yakutsk. On account of this scarcity
of provisions Spangberg was obliged partially to stop
work on the vessels. A part of his force was permitted
to go a-fishing, a part were sent to the magazines
in the country for their maintenance, while
others were detached to assist in the work of transportation;
hence it was with only a small force that
he could continue work on the ships for the American
voyage, the packet-boats St. Peter and St. Paul.</p>

<p>Sokoloff says: "Bering stayed three years in Okhotsk,
exerting himself to the utmost in equipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
expeditions, enduring continual vexations from the
Siberian government&mdash;especially on account of Pissarjeff&mdash;and
conducting frequent examinations and investigations
into the quarrels and complaints of his subordinates.
During all this time he was sternly and
unreasonably treated by the Admiralty, which showered
upon him threats and reproaches for slowness
sluggishness, and disorder, for false reports and ill-timed
accounts." Even as late as 1740 the Senate
made a proposition to discontinue the expedition, and
only by calling attention to the enormous expenditures
already made, which would in that case be completely
wasted, was the Admiralty allowed to continue it.
Bering was especially disheartened on account of Pissarjeff.
The latter arrived at Okhotsk at the same
time that Bering did, took up his abode in the old Ostrog
(fort) and immediately began his malicious annoyances.
His complaints and protests poured into headquarters
at Okhotsk. "For a correspondence with
him alone," writes Bering, "I might use three good
secretaries. I find his foul-tongued criticism extremely
offensive." He would capture Bering's men to give
them a drubbing, while his own deserted him to join
Bering, by whom they were kindly received. The
new town and the Ostrog were two hostile camps.
Finally Bering was compelled to make a sally to liberate
his men. The intrepid Spangberg, entirely out of
patience with Bering's leniency, said: "Why do you
give yourself so much trouble about this old knave?
Give me four men and the authority and I shall immediately
put him under arrest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, in 1738, Spangberg found it possible to
depart for Japan, and in two summer expeditions he
charted the Kurile Islands, Yezo, and a part of the
eastern coast of Nipon (Hondo), whereupon the cartography
of this part of the globe assumed an entirely
new appearance.</p>

<p>The expeditions to Japan, which employed four
ships and several hundred men, had exhausted the
provisions in Okhotsk. It was again necessary to raise
large supplies in West Siberia. A demand was made
upon the government office in Tobolsk for 40,000
rubles. From the district of Verkhoiansk 50,000
poods of provisions, while in part from West Siberia
and in part from the Admiralty 20,000 yards of cloth
were received. From other very distant places oil,
hemp, and other necessaries were obtained. The Admiralty
despatched to Irkutsk and Yakutsk two naval
officers, Lieutenants Tolbukhin and Larionoff, to superintend
the transportation of these goods. The number
of laborers was increased to a thousand, the roads
were improved, more attendants were provided, the
Siberian authorities exhibited more energy than before,
new river-boats were constructed, and pack-horses were
collected from a large radius of country; by these
increased means it was possible to collect all necessaries
in Okhotsk by 1740. In the month of June the
ships for the American expedition, the St. Peter and
the St. Paul, were launched. They were two-masters,
80 feet long, 22 feet wide, and 9&frac12; feet deep, rigged
as brigs, each of 108 tons burden, carrying 14 two
and three pound guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>In the harbor and on the Sea of Okhotsk there was
now quite a respectable fleet of eight or nine ships,
all built by Bering. The Arctic coasts had been
charted through his efforts. Spangberg had with great
success completed his task, and had been sent by
Bering to St. Petersburg to render a report. Bering's
own force, which consisted of 166 men, besides 80
engaged in transporting, was now collected in Okhotsk.
The astronomical department under La Croy&egrave;re and
the scientist Steller also arrived, and finally Bering
had the satisfaction of seeing his worst enemy removed.
In August, 1740, Pissarjeff was discharged, and poor
Antoni Devier, first a cabin boy, then successively aid-de-camp,
general, and chief of police in St. Petersburg&mdash;one
of Peter the Great's most trusted companions
in arms, but banished through the hatred of Menshikoff&mdash;became
his successor as harbor-master in
Okhotsk.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>In the middle of August the packet-boats, the
galley Okhotsk, and a double sloop containing the
scientists were ready to sail for Kamchatka. Then
Spangberg quite unexpectedly arrived. On his way
home he had received a counter order. The authorities
in St. Petersburg commanded him to repeat the
expedition to Japan. This gave Bering some extra
work in the way of letters and orders, so that the
vessels under Bering's and Chirikoff's commands
did not leave port until the 8th of September. They
were supplied with provisions for twenty months, and
their temporary destination was Avacha Bay on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>east coast of Kamchatka, where they were to pass the
winter. All the great enterprises which the government
had instructed Bering to undertake had now
been begun. In the following chapters will be found
a succinct account of the results of each.</p>

THE ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS.&mdash;THE NORTHEAST PASSAGE.&mdash;SEVERE
CRITICISMS ON NORDENSKJ&Ouml;LD.</h3>


<p>The Arctic expeditions made during the period from
1734 to 1743 have only in part any connection with
the object of this work. These expeditions were, it is
true, planned by Bering, and it was due to his activity
and perseverance that they were undertaken. He secured
vessels, men, and means, and had charge of the first unsuccessful
attempt; he was responsible to the government,
and in his zeal went just as far as his instructions would
allow him. But his own special task soon taxed his time
too heavily to permit him to assume charge of the Arctic
expeditions. They were not carried out until several
years after his departure from Yakutsk,&mdash;after he had
ceased to be their leader. We have already shown Bering's
important relation to them, something which has
never before been done in West European literature.
Hence our object, namely, to give Bering his dues, may
therefore best be accomplished by giving a short account
of the results achieved by these expeditions.</p>

<p>The world has never witnessed a more heroic geographical
enterprise than these Arctic expeditions. In five or
six different directions&mdash;from the Petchora, the Obi, the
Yenesei, and the Lena&mdash;the unknown coasts of the Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
World were attacked.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> For a whole decade these discoverers
struggled with all the obstacles which a terrible
climate and the resources of a half developed country
obliged them to contend with. They surmounted these
obstacles. The expeditions were renewed, two, three,
yes, even four times. If the vessels were frozen in, they
were hauled upon shore the next spring, repaired, and the
expedition continued. And if these intrepid fellows were
checked in their course by masses of impenetrable ice,
they continued their explorations on dog sledges, which
here for the first time were employed in Arctic exploration.
Cold, scurvy, and every degree of discomfort
wrought sad havoc among them, but many survived the
long polar winter in miserable wooden huts or barracks.
Nowhere has Russian hardiness erected for itself a more
enduring monument.</p>

<p>It was especially the projecting points and peninsulas
in this region that caused these explorers innumerable
difficulties. These points and capes had hitherto been
unknown. The crude maps of this period represented
the Arctic coast of Siberia as almost a straight line. It
was first necessary for the navigators to send cartographers
to these regions, build beacons and sea-marks, establish
magazines, collect herds of reindeer, which, partly as an
itinerant food supply, and partly to be used as an eventual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>means of conveyance, followed along the coast with the
vessels, while here and there, especially on the Taimyr
peninsula, small fishing stations were established for supplying
the vessels.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1737 Malygin and Skuratoff crossed
the Kara Sea and sailed up the Gulf of Obi. In the
same year the able Ofzyn charted the coast between the
Obi and the Yenesei, but was reduced to the rank of a
common sailor, because in Berezov he had sought the
company of the exiled Prince Dolgoruki.</p>

<p>In the year previous, Pronchisheff all but succeeded
in doubling the Taimyr peninsula, and reached the
highest latitude (77&deg; 29') that had been reached by water
before the Vega expedition. But it was especially in the
second attempt, from 1738 to 1743, that the greatest
results were attained. The two cousins, Chariton and
Dmitri Laptjef, who were equipped anew and vested with
great authority, attacked the task of doubling the
Taimyr and Bering peninsulas with renewed vigor. By
extensive sledging expeditions, the former linked his
explorations to those undertaken by Minin and Sterlegoff
from the west, and his mate, Chelyuskin, in 1742,
planted his feet on the Old World's most northerly point,
and thus relegated the story of a certain Jelmerland, said
to connect northern Asia with Novaia Zemlia, to that
lumber-room which contains so many ingenious cartographical
ideas. But even these contributions to science
were, perhaps, surpassed by those of Dmitri Laptjef. As
Lassenius's successor he charted, in three summers, the
Siberian coast from the Lena to the great Baranoff Cliff,
a distance of thirty-seven degrees. On this coast, toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the last, he found himself in a narrow strait, from ten to
twenty yards wide, and he did not stop until there was
scarcely a bucketful of water between the polar ice and
the rocky shore. But Cape Schelagskii, on the northeast
coast, where Deshneff a century before had shown the
way, he did not succeed in doubling.</p>

<p>As a result of the labors of this great Northern
Expedition, the northern coast of the Old World
got substantially the same cartographical outline that
it now has. The determinations of latitude made by
the Russian officers were very accurate, but those of
longitude, based on nautical calculations, were not so
satisfactory. Their successors, Wrangell, Anjou, Middendorff,
and even Nordenskj&ouml;ld, have therefore found
opportunity to make corrections of but minor importance,
especially in regard to longitude.</p>

<p>But it is necessary to dwell a little longer on
these expeditions. Their principal object was not so
much the charting of northern Siberia as the discovery
and navigation of the Northeast passage.
From this point of view alone they must be considered.
This is the connecting thought, the central
point in these scattered labors. They were an indirect
continuation of the West European expeditions
for the same purpose, but far more rational than
these. For this reason Bering had, on his expedition
of reconnoissance (1725-30), first sought that
thoroughfare between the two hemispheres without
which a Northeast and a Northwest passage could
not exist. For this reason also he had, on his far-sighted
plan, undertaken the navigation of the Arctic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
seas, where this had not already been done by Deshneff,
and for this same reason the Admiralty sought carefully
to link their explorations to the West European termini,
on the coast of Novaia Zemlia as well as Japan. Moreover,
the discovery of a Northeast passage was the <i>raison
d'&ecirc;tre</i> of these expeditions.</p>

<p>This alone promised the empire such commercial
and political advantages that the enormous expenditures
and the frightful hardships which these expeditions
caused Siberia, might be justified. For this
reason the government, summer after summer, drove
its sailors on along the Taimyr and Bering peninsulas;
for this reason, in 1740, it enjoined upon
D. Laptjef to make a last attempt to double northeast
Asia from Kamchatka, and this would undoubtedly
have been accomplished if the unfortunate death
of Bering had not occurred shortly after;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and for this
reason, also, the government caused the charting of the
coast by land after all nautical attempts had miscarried.</p>

<p>Any extended documentary proof of the correctness of
this view must be considered unnecessary. The instructions
expressly state the object of the expedition: to
ascertain with certainty whether vessels could find a
passage or not. M&uuml;ller says the same. Scholars like
Middendorff, Von Baer, and Dr. Petermann look upon
these expeditions from the same standpoint, and have
seen fit to give them the place of honor among all the
geographical efforts in the Northeast passage.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Some
Swedish scholars alone have found it necessary to maintain
a different view. Dr. A. Stuxberg and Prof. Th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Fries in Upsala have published accounts of the history
of the Northeast passage, in which not a word about
these expeditions is found. Between the days of Vlaming
and Cook, from 1688 until 1778, they find nothing
to be said of explorations in this part of the world, and
the charting of these waters does not, in their opinion,
seem to have any connection with the history of the
Northeast passage. Prof. Fries attempts to justify
this strange method of treatment by the assertion that
those expeditions did not seek the navigation of the
Northeast passage, and did not undertake to sail a ship
from the Atlantic to the Pacific. But what authority,
what historical foundation, have such assertions? Simply
because the Russians parceled out this work and went at
it in a sensible manner; because they did not loudly
proclaim their intention to sail directly from the Dwina
to Japan; because they had been instructed by the
visionary and fatal attempts of West Europe,&mdash;yes, one
is almost tempted to say, just because those Russian
expeditions alone are of any importance in the early
history of the passage, the Swedish historians pass them
by; Prof. Fries has even ventured the assertion that the
discovery of the Northeast passage by these Russian
expeditions, one hundred and thirty-seven years before
Nordenskj&ouml;ld, is a discovery hitherto unsurmised by
anyone but the author of this work. I am not disposed
to wrangle about words, and still less to interfere
with anyone's well-earned privileges. By the discovery
of the Northeast passage, I understand that work of
geographical exploration, that determination of the distribution
of land and water along the northern boundary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
of the Old World, that traversing and charting of the
coast which showed the existence of the passage, but
not the nautical utilization of it. This is the European
interpretation of this question. In any other sense
McClure did not discover the Northwest passage. If it is
permissible to speak of the discovery of the Northeast
passage after the time of Bering and the Great Northern
Expedition, it is equally permissible to speak of the
discovery of the Northwest passage after the time of the
great English expeditions. If some future Nordenskj&ouml;ld
should take it into his head to choose these waters as
the scene of some great nautical achievement, McClure,
according to Prof. Fries's historical maxims, could not
even find a place in the history of this passage, for it
was not his object to sail a ship around the north of
the New World. I very much doubt, however, that the
Professor would in such a case have the courage to
apply his maxims.</p>

<p>Nor does Baron Nordenskj&ouml;ld concede to the Great
Northern Expedition a place in the history of the Northeast
passage. The "Voyage of the Vega" is an imposing
work, and was written for a large public, but even the
author of this work has not been able to rise to an
unbiased and just estimate of his most important predecessors.
His presentation of the subject of Russian
explorations in the Arctic regions, not alone Bering's
work and that of the Great Northern Expedition, but
also Wrangell's, L&uuml;tke's, and Von Baer's, is unfair,
unsatisfactory, inaccurate, and hence misleading in
many respects. Nordenskj&ouml;ld's book comes with such
overpowering authority, and has had such a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
circulation, that it is one's plain duty to point out palpable
errors. Nordenskj&ouml;ld is not very familiar with the
literature relating to this subject. He does not know
Berch's, Stuckenberg's, or Sokoloff's works. Middendorff's
and Von Baer's clever treatises he uses only incidentally.
He has restricted himself to making extracts
from Wrangell's account, which in many respects is more
than incomplete, and does not put these expeditions in
the right light. It is now a couple of generations since
Wrangell's work was written, which is more a general
survey than an historical presentation. While Nordenskj&ouml;ld
devotes page after page to an Othere's, an Ivanoff's,
and a Martinier's very indifferent or wholly imaginary
voyages around northern Norway, he disposes of the Great
Northern Expedition, without whose labors the voyage
of the Vega would have been utterly impossible, in five
unhappily written pages. One seeks in vain in his work
for the principal object of the Northern Expedition,&mdash;for
the leading idea that made these magnificent enterprises
an organic whole, or for a full and just recognition
of these able, and, in some respects, unfortunate men,
whose labors have so long remained without due appreciation.
In spite of Middendorff's interesting account of
the cartography of the Taimyr peninsula, Nordenskj&ouml;ld
does not make the slightest attempt to explain whether
his corrections of the cartography of this region are
corrections of the work of Laptjef and Chelyuskin, or of
the misrepresentations of their work made by a later age.</p>

<p>About the charting of Cape Chelyuskin he says:
"This was done by Chelyuskin in 1742 on a new sledging
expedition, the details of which are but little known;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
evidently because until the most recent times there has
been a doubt in regard to Chelyuskin's statement that
he had reached the most northerly point of Asia.
After the voyage of the Vega, however, there can no
longer be any doubt."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The truth is, ever since 1843,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> when Middendorff
published the preliminary account of his expedition to
the Taimyr peninsula, no doubt has prevailed that all
who are familiar with Russian literature, or even with
German literature, on this subject, have long since been
convinced of the fact that the most northern point of
Asia was visited and charted a century and a half ago,&mdash;that
the details of Chelyuskin's expedition, so far from
being unknown, are those parts of the work of the Northern
Expedition which have been most thoroughly investigated
and most often presented. Nordenskj&ouml;ld's recognition
of Chelyuskin's work comes thirty-eight years too late;
it has already been treated with quite a different degree
of thoroughness than by the few words expended on it in
the "Voyage of the Vega." In 1841, Von Baer accused
Chelyuskin of having dishonestly given the latitude of
the most northerly point of Asia, and these charges Nordenskj&ouml;ld
prints as late as 1881 without any comment
whatever. If he had only seen Von Baer's magazine for
1845<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> he would there have found the most unreserved
retraction of them and most complete restitution to Chelyuskin
on the part of Von Baer, and would thus have
escaped ascribing to a man opinions which he renounced
a generation ago. Middendorff is likewise very painstaking
in presenting the history of these measurements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>and is open and frank in his praise. He says: "In the
spring of 1742 Chelyuskin crowned his work by sailing
from the Khatanga River around the eastern Taimyr
peninsula and also around the most northerly point of
Asia. He is the only one who a century ago had succeeded
in reaching and doubling this promontory. The
fact that among many he alone was successful in this
enterprise, must be attributed to his great ability. On
account of his perseverance, as well as his careful and
exact measurements, he stands pre&euml;minent among seamen
who have labored in the Taimyr country." And
furthermore, in 1785, Sokoloff published a very careful
and extensive account of these labors, together with an
extract from Chelyuskin's diary relating to the charting
of the Taimyr peninsula, which later was published in
German by Dr. Petermann.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The difference in latitude
of the northern point of the Taimyr peninsula as determined
by Chelyuskin and by Nordenskj&ouml;ld is scarcely
three minutes.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

nearly two pages to showing that I am wrong in what I have said of Chelyuskin&mdash;that
'up to a recent date the statement that he really did reach the
northern point of Asia was doubted.' But I had certainly the right to say
this. If a person in 1742 performed one of the heroic deeds of geography
without having received any acknowledgment for it in his lifetime, and if
the best authorities in this person's own country a century later still considered
him an impostor, I was surely justified in giving the above-quoted opinion
in 1880, in spite of the fact that two eminent geographical authorities have
withdrawn their charges. Moreover, is it really the case that Sokoloff's and
Von Baer's later writings made it impossible to revive the old charge? He who
can assert this must be but slightly acquainted with the history of geography,
and with that of Siberian geography above all." In a note Nordenskj&ouml;ld
adds: "Previous to the departure of the Vega from Sweden, I received a letter
from an unknown well-wisher to our voyage, cautioning me not to put too
much faith in the Chelyuskin exploration story, as the writer of the letter
considered it fictitious." To the Baron's criticism I shall simply remark: I
have shown in the text that when he wrote the "Voyage of the Vega" he
was not familiar with the latest works on this question. Hence he has been
entirely unable to decide whether the old doubts concerning Chelyuskin's
results could be revived or not. I appeal to all students of these finer points
in the history of geography, who will certainly agree with my statement that
the Baron in this question has absolutely no other support than that of an
anonymous letter!&mdash;<i>Author's Note to American Edition.</i></p></div></div>

THE DISCOVERY OF THE KURILE ISLANDS AND JAPAN
FROM THE NORTH.</h3>


<p>The men that took part in these early Russian
explorations have not yet received their just dues.
Not one of them, however, needs rehabilitation so much
as Spangberg. He is entitled to an independent place
in geographical history, but has been completely barred
out. O. Peschel and Prof. Ruge know him as Bering's
principal officer, but not as the discoverer of the Kurile
Islands and Japan from the north. And yet, just this
was his task. He was to sail from Kamchatka to Nipon,
chart the Kurile Islands, link the Russian explorations
to the West European cartography of northern Japan,
and investigate the geography of the intervening region,&mdash;especially
the cartographical monsters which in the
course of a century of contortion had developed from
De Vries's intelligent map of East Yezo, Iturup (Staaten
Eiland) and Urup (Kompagniland). We have already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>spoken of these geographical deformities, which assumed
the most grotesque forms, and were at that time accepted
by the scientific world. The version of the brothers
De l'Isle, which perhaps was the most sober, may be
seen from Map II. in the appendix.</p>

<p>By Strahlenberg (1730) and by Bellin and Charlesvoix
(1735), highly respected names among scholars of that
day, Kamchatka and Yezo were represented as forming a
great continent separated by narrow sounds from Japan,
which was continued on the meridian of Kamchatka
and Yezo, and from an eastern chain of islands&mdash;Staaten
Eiland and Kompagniland&mdash;that seemed to project into
the Pacific in the form of a continent.</p>

<p>Kiriloff, who was familiar with Bering's map of eastern
Asia, and made use of it, and who knew of the
most northerly Kuriles, made the necessary corrections
in his general map of Russia (1734), but retained, in
regard to Yezo and Japan, a strangely unfortunate composition
of Dutch and Strahlenberg accounts, and put
Nipon (Hondo) much too far to the east. In these
cartographical aids Spangberg found only errors and
confusion, and he got about the same kind of assistance
from his real predecessors in practical exploration.
Peschel tells that Ivan Kosyrefski, in the years 1712-13,
thoroughly investigated the Kurile chain; there is, however,
but little truth in this. Peschel gives G. F.
M&uuml;ller as his authority and refers to his book, but the
latter says explicitly on this point: "All of Kosyrefski's
voyages were confined to the first two or three Kuriles;
farther than this he did not go, and whatever he tells
of beyond them was obtained from the accounts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
others." It is possible that M&uuml;ller's judgment is a trifle
one-sided, but it is nevertheless certain that Kosyrefski's
description of the Kuriles is based on his own explorations
only in a very slight degree, and that he by no
means deserves the place that Peschel and Ruge have
accorded him. Nor did Lushin's and Yevrinoff's expedition
in the summer of 1721 get very far&mdash;scarcely
beyond the fifth or sixth island&mdash;and with them, until
Spangberg appeared on the scene, Russian explorations
in this quarter were at a standstill.</p>

<p>The expedition to Japan (1738) was undertaken with
three ships. Spangberg and Petroff sailed the one-masted
brig, the Archangel Michael, Lieutenant Walton
and first mate Kassimiroff the three-masted double sloop
Hope, and Second-Lieutenant Schelting had Bering's
old vessel, the Gabriel. The Michael had a crew of
sixty-three, among them a monk, a physician, and an
assayer, and each of the other two ships had a crew of
forty-four. The flotilla left Okhotsk on the 18th of June,
1738, but was detained in the Sea of Okhotsk by ice,
and did not reach Bolsheretsk until the early part of
July. From here, on the 15th of July, Spangberg
departed for the Kuriles to begin charting.</p>

<p>The Kurile chain, the thousand islands or Chi-Shima,
as the Japanese call them, is 650 kilometers long. These
islands are simply a multitude of crater crests which
shoot up out of the sea, and on that account make navigation
very difficult. The heavy fog, which almost continually
prevails here, conceals all landmarks. In the
great depths, sounding afforded little assistance, and,
furthermore, around these islands and through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
narrow channels there are heavy breakers and swift
currents.</p>

<p>For nearly a century after Spangberg, these obstacles
defied some of the world's bravest seamen. Captain
Gore, who was last in command of Cook's ships, was
obliged to give up the task of charting this region; La
P&eacute;rouse succeeded in exploring only the Boussale channel;
the fogs forced Admiral Sarycheff (1792) to give
up his investigations here; Captain Broughton (1796)
was able to circumnavigate only the most southerly
islands, without, however, succeeding in giving a correct
representation of them; and not until the early
part of this century did Golovnin succeed in charting
the group more accurately than Spangberg. All of
these difficulties were experienced in full measure
by Spangberg's expedition. In constant combat with
fogs, swift currents, and heavy seas along steep and
rocky coasts, he had, by the 3d of August, 1738, circumnavigated
thirty-one islands (our maps have not
nearly so large a number), and at a latitude of 45&deg; 30'
he reached the large island Nadeshda, (the Kompagniland
of the Dutch, Urup), but, as he could nowhere
find a place to anchor, and as the nights were growing
dark and long, the ship's bread running short, and the
crew for a long time having been on half rations, he
turned back, and reached Bolsheretsk on the 17th of
August. Lieutenant Walton, who had parted company
with his chief and had sailed as far down as 43&deg; 30'
north latitude, thus reaching the parallel of Yezo,
arrived a few days later. As well as the other chiefs of
these expeditions, Spangberg had authority, without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
renewed commission, to repeat the expedition the following
summer; hence the winter was spent in preparations
for it. So far as it was possible to do so, he sought to
provision himself in Kamchatka, and, especially for
reconnoitering the coast, he built of birchwood an eighteen-oared
boat, called the Bolsheretsk.</p>

<p>On the 21st of May, 1739, he again stood out to sea
with all four ships, and on the 25th of the same month
he reached Kurile Strait, and from here sailed south
southeast into the Pacific to search for Gamaland and all
the legendary group of islands which appeared on De
l'Isle's map. This southerly course, about on the meridian
of Kamchatka, he kept until the 8th of June, reaching
a latitude of 42&deg;. As he saw nothing but sea and
sky, he veered to the west southwest for the purpose of
"doing the lands" near the coast of Japan. Walton,
who, in spite of Spangberg's strictest orders, was constantly
seeking to go off on his own tack, finally, on the
14th of June, found an opportunity to steal away and
sail in a southwesterly direction. In different latitudes,
but on the same day, the 16th of June, both discovered
land. Walton followed the coast of Nipon down to latitude
33&deg;, but Spangberg confined his explorations to the
region between 39&deg; and 37&deg; 30' N. The country was very
rich. A luxuriant vegetation&mdash;grape vines, orange trees
and palms&mdash;decked its shores. Rich fields of rice, numerous
villages, and populous cities were observed from the
vessel. The sea teemed with fish of enormous size and
peculiar form, and the currents brought them strange
and unknown plants. The arrival of the ships caused
great excitement among the natives, beacons burned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
along the coast all night, and cruisers swarmed about
them at a respectful distance. On the 22d, Spangberg
cast anchor one verst from shore, and sought to communicate
with them. The Japanese brought rice, tobacco,
various kinds of fruits and cloths, which, on very reasonable
terms, they exchanged for Russian wares. They
were very polite, and Spangberg succeeded in obtaining
some gold coins, which, however, he found were described
by K&aelig;mpfer. Several persons of high rank visited him
in his cabin and attempted to explain to him, by the aid
of his map and globe, the geography of Japan and Yezo.
As his instructions enjoined upon him the most extreme
cautiousness, and as on the following day he found himself
surrounded by eighty large boats, each with ten or
twelve men, he weighed anchor and stood out to sea in a
northeasterly direction.</p>

<p>It was Spangberg's purpose to chart the southern part
of the Kurile Islands, and, as will be seen from his chart,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
he sought to accomplish his task, and thus complete his
work of 1738. The casual observer will, however, find
this map unsatisfactory and inaccurate, and will not
only be quite confused in viewing these islands so promiscuously
scattered about, and which seemingly do
not correspond with the actual geography of this region
as known to us, but he will even be inclined to suspect
Spangberg of gross fraud. This is certainly very unjust,
however, and after a careful study of a modern map, I
venture the following opinion on this subject: In order
to be able to understand his chart and course, the most
essential thing necessary is simply to determine his first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>place of landing in the Kuriles, the island Figurnyi, and
to identify it with its present name. He discovered this
island on the 3d of July. M&uuml;ller says that, according to
the ship's journal, it is in latitude 43&deg; 50' N., and in spite
of the fact that Spangberg's determinations in longitude,
based on the ship's calculations, were as a rule somewhat
inaccurate, which in a measure is shown by Nipon's being
located so far west, he is nevertheless in this case right.
Figurnyi is the island Sikotan and has the astronomical
position of this island on the chart (according to Golovnin
43&deg; 53' N. and 146&deg; 43' 30" E.). This opinion is corroborated
by a map of the Russian discoveries published at
St. Petersburg in 1787, and by Captain Broughton, who
described the island in the fall of 1796, and gave it the
name of Spangberg's Island, in honor of its first discoverer.
With this point fixed, it is not difficult to
understand and follow Spangberg.</p>

<p>Spangberg labored under very unfavorable circumstances.
It rained constantly, the coast was enveloped in
heavy fogs, and at times it was impossible to see land at
a distance of eight yards. From Figurnyi he sailed
southwest, but under these difficult circumstances he
took the little islands of Taroko and the northern point
of Yezo to be one continuous coast (Seljonyi, the green
island), and anchored at the head of Walvisch bay, his
Bay of Patience. From here he saw the western shore of
the bay, reached its farthest point, Cape Notske, and
discovered the peninsula of Sirokot and parts of the
island Kumashiri, which he called Konosir and Tsyntrounoi
respectively; but, as he turned from Cape Notske
and sailed east into the Pacific, between Sikotan and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Taroko Islands, he did not reach the Kurile Islands themselves,
and only the most northerly island in the group
of the "Three Sisters" may possibly be the southern
point of Iturup. He then proceeded along the eastern
coast of Yezo, took the deep bay of Akischis as a strait
separating Seljonyi and Konosir, then crossed in a southerly
direction the large bay on the central coast of Yezo,
without seeing land at its head, to Cape Jerimo (his
Matmai), and had thus navigated the whole east coast of
Yezo; but on account of the heavy fog, which prevented
him from seeing the exact outline of the coast, he made
three islands of Yezo: Matmai, Seljonyi and Konosir. In
1643, De Vries had in his map linked a number of islands
together, making one stretch of country called Je&ccedil;o, and
now Spangberg had gone to the opposite extreme.</p>

<p>These explorations engaged Spangberg from the 3d to
the 25th of July. He several times met inhabitants of
North Yezo, the A&iuml;no people, whose principal characteristics
he has fully described, but as his men were suffering
from scurvy, causing frequent deaths among them
(by August 29, when he arrived at Okhotsk, he had
lost thirteen, among them the physician), he resolved to
turn at Cape Jerimo, and on his return trip keep his
course so close to the Kuriles that he might strike the
extreme points of De l'Isle's Je&ccedil;o, all of Kompagniland,
and the most westerly parts of Gamaland.</p>

<p>Spangberg's explorations were far from exhaustive.
He but partly succeeded in lifting the veil that so
persistently concealed the true outline of this irregularly
formed part of the globe. His reconnoissance was to
ascertain the general oceanic outline of these coasts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
His charting of Yezo and Saghalin was left to a much
later day,&mdash;to La P&eacute;rouse, to Krusenstern, Golovnin, and
others. But Spangberg's expedition nevertheless marks
great progress in our geographical knowledge, for not
only did he irrevocably banish the cartographical myths
of that region, and, on the whole, give a correct representation
of the Kurile islands clear to Iturup, the next
to the last of them, but he also determined the position
of North Japan, and fully accomplished his original
task, namely, to show the Russians the way to Japan,
and thus add this long disputed part of the Northeast
passage to the other explorations for the same purpose.</p>

<p>As was the case with that of all of his colleagues,
so Spangberg's reputation suffered under the violent
administrative changes and that system of suppression
which later prevailed in Russia. His reports were never
made public. The Russian cartographers made use of
his chart, but they did not understand how to fit
judiciously his incomplete coast-lines to those already
known, or to distinguish right from wrong. They even
omitted the course of his vessel, thus excluding all
possibility of understanding his work. Hence Spangberg's
chart never reached West Europe, and Cook found
it necessary to reinstate him as well as Bering.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> After
that the feeling was more favorable, and Coxe,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> for
instance, used his representation of the Kuriles; but new
and better outlines of this region appeared about this
time, and Spangberg again sank into complete oblivion.</p>

<p>Spangberg's safe return was a bright spot in the
history of the Great Northern Expedition, and Bering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>was very well satisfied with the results. He permitted
him and his crew to go to Yakutsk to obtain rest, and
ordered him to return to St. Petersburg the next spring
to render in person an account of the results of the
expedition. His preliminary report, sent in advance,
received considerable attention in the cabinet of the
Empress, and caused much talk in the leading circles of
the capital. While in Yakutsk, he received orders to
travel day and night to reach St. Petersburg. Meanwhile,
however, his old enemy Pissarjeff had also been
active. Surreptitiously, especially from Walton, who
was constantly at enmity with his chief, he had obtained
some information concerning the expedition and had
reported to the Senate that Spangberg had not been in
Japan at all, but off the coast of Corea. This assertion
he sought to prove by referring to pre-Spangberg maps,
which, as we have noted, placed Japan eleven or twelve
degrees too far east, directly south of Kamchatka. This
gossip was credited in the Senate, and a courier was
dispatched to stop Spangberg. At Fort Kirinsk, on the
Lena, in the summer of 1740, he received orders to
return to Okhotsk and repeat his voyage to Japan, while
a commission of naval officers and scholars betook themselves
to investigate the matter. These wise men, after
several years of deliberation, came to the conclusion that
Walton had been in Japan, and that Spangberg most
probably had been off the coast of Corea. In the
summer of 1742, he started out on his third expedition to
Japan, but as this was a complete failure, undoubtedly
due to Spangberg's anger on account of the government's
unjust and insane action, and as it has no geographical
significance, we shall give it no further consideration.</p>

PREPARATIONS FOR BERING'S VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY
TO AMERICA.&mdash;FOUNDING OF PETROPAVLOVSK.&mdash;THE
BROTHERS DE L'ISLE.</h3>


<p>We left Bering when, in 1740, he was about to
depart from the harbor of Okhotsk with the St.
Peter and the St. Paul, two smaller transports, and a
vessel to convey the scientists, Steller and La Croy&egrave;re, to
Bolsheretsk. The objective point of the main expedition
was Avacha Bay, on the eastern coast of Kamchatka.
The excellent harbors here had been discovered by
Bering's crew a couple of years previous. He had now
sent his mate, Yelagin, to chart the bay, find a sheltered
harbor there, and establish a fortified place of abode on
this coast. This work Yelagin completed in the summer
of 1740, and when in the latter part of September the
packet boats entered Avacha Bay, they found, in a
smaller bay on the north side, Niakina Cove, some barracks
and huts. A fort was built in the course of
the winter and the pious Bering had a church built
and consecrated to St. Peter and St. Paul, thus founding
the present town of Petropavlovsk. The place rapidly
became the most important and pleasant town of the
peninsula, although that is not saying much. In 1779,
the place was still so insignificant that Cook's officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
searched long in vain for it with their field-glasses,
but finally discovered about thirty huts on that point
which shelters the harbor. In the middle of this century
it had about a thousand inhabitants, but since the
sale of Russian America, Bering's town has been hopelessly
on the decline. At present it has scarcely 600
inhabitants and is of importance only to the fur trade.</p>

<p>Its first permanent inhabitants were brought from
the forts on the Kamchatka, and in the course of the
autumn there arrived from Anadyrskoi Ostrog a herd
of reindeer to supply the command of over two hundred
men with food, and thus spare other stores. This was
very necessary, for although Bering had left Okhotsk
with nearly two years' provisions, one of the ships,
through the carelessness of an officer, stranded in crossing
the Okhotsk bar, and the cargo, consisting of the
ship's bread for the voyage to America, was destroyed
and could not immediately be replaced. Some lesser
misfortunes in Avacha Bay further diminished the stores,
and hence, in the course of the winter, Bering found it
necessary to have large supplies brought across the
country from Bolsheretsk. The distance is about one
hundred and forty miles, and as nothing but dogs could
be procured, the natives were gathered from the remotest
quarters of the peninsula to accomplish this work of
transportation. The Kamshadales disliked journeys very
much. They had already suffered terribly under the
misrule of the Cossacks. They were treated cruelly,
and many died of overwork and want, and the rest lost
patience. The tribes in the vicinity of Tigil revolted.
The Cossack chief Kolessoff, who was constantly drunk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
neglected to superintend the transportation, and as a
result, much was injured or ruined. Some of those supplies
arrived too late to be used for the expedition.
Bering's original plan was to spend two years on this
expedition. He was to winter on the American coast,
navigate it from 60&deg; N. latitude to Bering Strait, and
then return along the coast of Asia. But this had to be
abandoned.</p>

<p>In May, 1741, when the ice broke up, he could
supply his ships with frugal, not to say very poor, provisions,
for only five and a half months. Moreover,
his ship's stores and reserve rigging were both incomplete
and inadequate. Bering's powers of resistance
now began to wane. After eight years of incessant
trouble and toil, after all the accusations and suspicions
he had undergone, he was now forced to face the thought
of an unsatisfactory conclusion of his first voyage, at
least. Besides, Spangberg's fate could not but have a
very depressing influence, for it told Bering and his
associates that even with the best of results it would
hardly be possible to overcome the prejudices of the
government authorities or their lack of confidence in
the efforts of the new marine service. Undoubtedly it
was such thoughts as these that swayed Bering and
Chirikoff, when, on the 4th of May, they called the
ship's council to consider the prospective voyage (the
proceedings are not known). Although both, as well
as the best of their officers, were of the opinion that
America<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> was to be sought in a direction east by
north from Avacha, and in spite of the fact that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>were both familiar with Gvosdjeff's discovery of the American
coast of Bering Strait (1732), and that their observations
during the course of the winter had amply corroborated
Bering's earlier opinion, they nevertheless
allowed themselves to be prevailed upon to search first
in a southeasterly direction for the legendary Gamaland.
And thus the lid of Pandora's box was lifted.</p>

<p>This fatal resolution was due principally to the
brothers De l'Isle, and, as this name is most decisively
connected with Bering's life and renown, we must say
a few words about these brothers. The elder and more
talented, Guillaume De l'Isle, undoubtedly represented
the geographical knowledge of his day, but he died as
early as 1726. He came in personal contact with the Czar
during the latter's visit in Paris, and corresponded with
him afterwards. His maps were the worst stumbling
blocks to Bering's first voyage. The younger brother,
Joseph Nicolas, on the other hand, was called to Russia
in 1726, on his brother's recommendation, and was
appointed chief astronomer of the newly founded
Academy. In this position he was for twenty-one years
engaged upon the cartography of the great Russian
empire. Under his supervision the atlas of the Academy
appeared in 1745, and it was supposed that he carried
very valuable geographical collections with him to Paris
in 1747. But if this was the case, he did not understand
how to make proper use of them, and, as it is, he is of
no geographical importance. When he went to Russia,
he took with him, without special invitation, his elder
brother, Louis, and did everything to secure him a scientific
position in the country. Louis seems to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
an amiable good-for-nothing, who highly prized a good
table and a social glass, but cared as little as possible
for scientific pursuits. When, as a young man, he
studied theology in Paris, his father found it necessary
to send him to Canada, where he assumed his mother's
name, La Croy&egrave;re, and for seventeen years lived a soldier's
wild life, until his brothers, on the death of the
father, recalled him from his exile. In St. Petersburg
his brother instructed him in the elements of astronomy,
sent him upon a surveying expedition to Lapland, and
finally secured him a position as chief astronomer of
Bering's second expedition. This was a great mistake.
Louis de l'Isle de la Croy&egrave;re very unsatisfactorily filled
his position. His Academic associates M&uuml;ller and Gmelin
had no regard for him whatever, and hence under the
pressure of this contempt, and as a result of this irregular
and protracted life in a barbaric country, La Croy&egrave;re,
having no native power of resistance, sank deeper and
deeper into hopeless sluggishness. His astronomical
determinations in Kamchatka are worthless. His Russian
assistants, especially Krassilnikoff, did this part of
the work of the expedition.</p>

<p>As early as 1730, Bering, as we have seen, came into
unfortunate relations with Joseph De l'Isle, and this state
of affairs afterwards grew gradually worse. In 1731, the
Senate requested the latter to construct a map of the
northern part of the Pacific in order to present
graphically the still unsolved problems for geographical
research. He submitted this map to the Senate on the
6th of October, 1732, that is, two years and a half after
Bering's proposition to undertake the Great Northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Expedition, but this did not deter him, in 1750, from
ascribing to himself, on the basis of this same map and
an accompanying memoir, Bering's proposition, nor from
publishing an entirely perverted account of Bering's
second expedition. He clung to all of his brother's conjectures
about Gamaland, Kompagniland, and Staatenland
as well as Je&ccedil;o, although they were based on very unreliable
accounts and the cartographical distortions of several
generations. On the other hand, he most arbitrarily
rejected all Russian accounts of far more recent and reliable
origin, so that only Bering's and part of Yevrinoff's
and Lushin's outlines of the first Kuriles were allowed to
appear on the official map. He would rather reject all
Russian works that could be made doubtful, than his
brother's authority, and even in 1753, over twenty years
after Spangberg's and Bering's voyages, he persistently
sought to maintain his brother Guillaume's and his own
unreasonable ideas concerning the cartography of this
region. It was in part this dogged persistence in clinging
to family prejudices that robbed Spangberg of his
well-earned reward and brought Bering's last expedition
to a sad end.</p>

<p>When the second Kamchatkan expedition left St. Petersburg,
a copy of De l'Isle's map was given to Bering as
well as to La Croy&egrave;re. De l'Isle wrote the latter's
instructions&mdash;ably written, by the way&mdash;and it was a
result of his efforts that the Senate ordered Bering and
Chirikoff to consult with La Croy&egrave;re concerning the
route to America,&mdash;a very reasonable decree in case he
had been a good geographer. As it was, the order simply
meant that they were to go according to the regulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
of De l'Isle in St. Petersburg. In the ship's council on
the 4th of May, 1741, La Croy&egrave;re immediately produced
the above-mentioned map, and directed the expedition first
to find Gamaland, which, it was claimed, could lie but a
few days' sailing toward the southeast, and would furnish
good assistance in finding America. But La Croy&egrave;re
was only a spokesman for his brother, who in his memoir
had constructed his principal reasoning on this basis. He
says here that America can be reached from the Chukchee
peninsula as well as from the mouth of the Kamchatka
River, but with greatest ease and certainty from
Avacha Bay in a southeasterly direction to the northern
coast of Gamaland. In order to support this supposition
he adds: "It grieves me not to have found other information
about this land seen by Don Juan de Gama than
what is given on the map of my late brother, his most
Christian Majesty's first geographer. But as he indicated
the position of this country with reference to Kompagniland
and Je&ccedil;o, and as I am certain, from other sources,
of the position of these two countries, I am consequently
convinced of their correct situation and distance from
Kamchatka."</p>

<p>That these miserable arguments exercised any influence
upon the ship's council on the 4th of May, would
seem impossible, if we did not bear in mind the conduct
of the authorities in St. Petersburg. Two years previous
Spangberg had sailed right across Kompagniland, Staatenland
and Je&ccedil;o, and thus made every point in De l'Isle's
argument untenable. Bering and Chirikoff were familiar
with the results of these voyages, and shared Spangberg's
opinion. For this reason they could not possibly ascribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
any great importance to De l'Isle's directions which were
based on antiquated assumptions, but on the other hand,
they had neither moral nor practical independence enough
to take their own course. The government laws, and
especially the Senate decrees, bound their hands. They
were to submit all important measures to the action of
a commission, and were far from being sovereign commanders
in any modern sense. Under these circumstances
they found it advisable, and possibly necessary, to
act in accordance with the opinion of these learned scholars,
so as to be able later to defend themselves in every
particular against the criticisms of the Academy. Hence
the commission resolved that the expedition should first
find the northern coast of Gamaland, follow this coast in
an easterly direction to America, and turn back in time to
be at home in Avacha Bay by the end of September. In
this way their ships were carried far into the Pacific and
away from the Aleutian chain of islands, which, like the
thread of Ariadne, would speedily have led them to the
western continent.</p>

THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA FROM THE EAST.&mdash;STELLER
INDUCED TO JOIN THE EXPEDITION.&mdash;THE SEPARATION
OF THE ST. PETER AND THE ST. PAUL.</h3>


<p>In the course of the month of May the vessels were
equipped and supplied with provisions for five and
a half months, several cords of wood, 100 casks of water,
and two rowboats each. The St. Peter, commanded by
Bering, had a crew of 77, among whom were Lieutenant
Waxel, shipmaster Khitroff, the mates Hesselberg, and
Jushin, the surgeon Betge, the conductor Plenisner,
Ofzyn (whom we remember as the officer who had been
reduced in rank), and Steller. On board the St. Paul,
commanded by Lieut. Alexei Chirikoff, were found the
marine officers Chegatchoff and Plautin, La Croy&egrave;re, and
the assistant surgeon Lau,&mdash;in all about 76 men. Before
his departure, Bering had a very difficult matter to
arrange. His instructions directed him to take with him
to America a mineralogist; but when Spangberg had
started out on his unexpected expedition to Japan, Bering
had sent with him the mineralogist Hartelpol, and now
he found it impossible in East Siberia to get a man to fill
his place. Hence, as early as February, Bering applied to
Steller and tried to induce him to take upon himself the
duties of naturalist and mineralogist on this expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Steller was born at Windsheim, Germany, in 1709. He
first studied theology and had even begun to preach, when
the study of science suddenly drew him from the church.
He studied medicine and botany, passed the medical examinations
in Berlin, and lectured on medicine in Halle.
Then, partly as a matter of necessity and partly from a
desire to travel, he went to Danzig, where he became surgeon
on a Russian vessel, and finally, after a series of
vicissitudes, he landed in St. Petersburg as a lecturer in
the Academy of Science. According to his own desire he
went to Siberia as Gmelin's and M&uuml;ller's assistant, and,
as these gentlemen found it altogether too uncomfortable
to travel any farther east than Yakutsk, he took upon
himself the exploration of Kamchatka. He was an
enthusiast in science, who heeded neither obstacles nor
dangers, a keen and successful observer, who has enriched
science with several classical chapters, and had an ardent
and passionate nature that attacked without regard to
persons every form of injustice. His pen could be shaped
to epigrammatic sharpness, and his tongue spared no one.
In 1741, he wished to extend his investigations to Japan,
and had, when Bering sought to secure his services, sent
to the Academy a request to be permitted to participate
in Spangberg's third expedition. Steller had, however,
great hesitancy about leaving his special field of investigation
without orders or permission, and Bering had to
assume all responsibility to the Senate and Academy, and
also secure for him from a council of all the ship's officers
an assurance of the position as mineralogist of the expedition,
before he could be induced to accept. Bering is
said to have charged him verbally to make observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
in all the departments of natural history, and promised
him all necessary assistance. Steller accuses Bering of
not having kept his promises, and, although he preserved
until the last a high regard for Bering's seamanship and
noble character, there nevertheless developed, during the
expedition, a vehement enmity between Steller and the
naval officers, especially Waxel and Khitroff, and this
enmity found very pregnant expression in Steller's diary,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
which, in this respect, is more a pamphlet than a description
of travel. It is impossible, however, with our present
resources, to ascertain the true state of affairs. Concerning
Bering's voyage to America, we have only the St.
Peter's journals kept by Waxel, Jushin, and Khitroff, and
an account by Waxel, all of which have been used by
Sokoloff in the preparation of the memoirs of the hydrographic
department. Steller's diary, which goes into a
detailed account of things in quite a different way than
the official reports, was also used by Sokoloff, but as the
latter had but little literary taste and still less sympathy
for the contending parties, especially for Bering, he does
not attempt to dispense justice between them. Steller's
criticism must be looked upon as an eruption of that ill-humor
which so often and so easily arises in the relations
between the chief of an expedition and the accompanying
scientists, between men with divergent interests and different
aims. Bering and Steller, Cook and his naturalists,
Kotzebue and Chamisso, are prominent examples of
this disagreement. It is well known that Cook called the
naturalists "the damned disturbers of the peace," and
that he more than once threatened to put them off on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>some island or other in the ocean. Steller accuses Bering
of having too much regard for his subordinate officers,
but in all likelihood these had made the countercharge
that he gave too much heed to the scientists. At any
rate, Bering has often been blamed for&mdash;in accordance
with his instruction&mdash;letting La Croy&egrave;re take part in the
councils at Avacha. But we must not forget that Steller
was a hot-headed and passionate fellow who persistently
maintained his own opinions. From many points in his
accounts, it appears that during this whole expedition he
was in a state of geographical confusion; and even after
his return he seemed to imagine that the two continents
were separated by simply a narrow channel. He was
guided by observations of a scientific nature, and, as the
course of the St. Peter was no farther from the Aleutian
Islands than the appearance of seaweed, seals, and birds
indicated, he constantly imagined that they were off the
coast of the New World. The naval officers, on the other
hand, sought guidance in sounding; but as their course
carried them out upon the great depths of the Pacific, the
northern wall of which very precipitously ascends to the
Aleutian Islands, their measurements were of no assistance,
and in various points Steller was undoubtedly correct.
The principal reason for Steller's complaint must
be sought in Bering's illness, and it is easily perceived
that, if the scurvy had not at a very early stage undermined
his strength, his superior seamanship would have
secured the expedition quite different results than those
that were obtained.</p>

<p>After a prayer service, the ships weighed anchor on the
4th of June, 1741. Expectations on board were great,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
New World was to open up before them. According
to the plan adopted, a southeasterly course was taken,
and in spite of some unfortunate friction, Bering gave
Chirikoff the lead, so as to leave him no cause for complaint.
They kept their course until the afternoon of
June 12, when they found themselves, after having sailed
over six hundred miles in a southeasterly direction, in
latitude 46&deg; 9' N. and 14&deg; 30' east of Avacha. According
to De l'Isle's map they should long before have come to
the coasts of Gamaland, but as they only saw sea and sky,
Bering gave the command to turn back. With variable
and unfavorable winds, they worked their way, during
the few succeeding days, in a direction of N. N. E. up to
latitude 49&deg; 30', where Chirikoff, on the 20th of June, in
storm and fog, left Bering and sailed E. N. E. in the
direction of the American coast, without attempting to
keep with the St. Peter. This was the first real misfortune
of the expedition. For forty-eight hours Bering
kept close to the place of separation, in hopes of
again joining the St. Paul, and, as this proved fruitless,
he convened a ship's council, at which it was decided
to give up all further search for the St. Paul; it was
also resolved&mdash;in order to remove every doubt&mdash;to
sail again to the 46th degree to find Gamaland. Having
arrived here, some birds were seen, whereupon they
continued their course to 45&deg; 16' N. and 16&deg; 28' east of
Avacha, but of course without any results. During the
four succeeding weeks, the ship's course was between
north and east, toward the western continent, but as on
their southern course they had come out upon the depths
of Tuscarora, which, several thousand fathoms deep, run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
right up to the Aleutian reef, their soundings gave them
no clue to land, although they were sailing almost parallel
with this chain of islands. But Bering was now confined
to his cabin. The troubles he had passed through,
his sixty years of age, and the incipient stages of scurvy,
had crushed his powers of resistance, while his officers,
Waxel and Khitroff, dismissed Steller's observations with
scornful sarcasm. Not until the 12th of July did they
take any precautions against a sudden landing. They
took in some of the sails during the night and hove to.
They had then been on the sea about six weeks. Their
supply of water was about half gone, and according to the
ship's calculations, which show an error of 8&deg;, they had
sailed 46&frac12;&deg; (<i>i. e.</i>, 54&frac12;&deg;) from the meridian of Avacha.
The ship's council therefore concluded, on the 13th of
July, to sail due north, heading N. N. E., and at noon
on the 16th of July, in a latitude by observation of
58&deg; 14' and a longitude of 49&frac12;&deg; east of Avacha, they
finally saw land to the north.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The country was elevated,
the coast was jagged, covered with snow, inhospitable,
and girt with islands, behind which a snow-capped
mountain peak towered so high into the clouds that it
could be seen at a distance of seventy miles. "I do not
remember," says Steller, "of having seen a higher mountain
in all Siberia and Kamchatka." This mountain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>was the volcano St. Elias, which is about 18,000 feet
high. <i>Bering had thus succeeded in discovering America
from the east.</i> As they had a head wind, they moved very
slowly toward the north, and not until the morning of the
20th did they cast anchor off the western coast of an
island which they called Sct. Ilii (St. Elias) in honor of
the patron saint of the day. On the same day, Khitroff
with fifteen men went, in the ship's boat, to search for a
harbor and to explore the island and its nearest surroundings.
Steller, who had desired to accompany him, was
put ashore with the crew that brought fresh water from
St. Elias, and endeavored, as well as it was possible in a
few hours, to investigate the natural history of the island.
Khitroff circumnavigated the island and found various
traces of human habitation. Thus, on one of the adjacent
islands, a timbered house was found containing a fireplace,
a bark basket, a wooden spade, some mussel shells, and a
whetstone, which apparently had been used for sharpening
copper implements. In an earth-hut another detachment
had found some smoked fish, a broken arrow, the
remains of a fire, and several other things. The coast of
the mainland, which was mountainous with snow-capped
peaks, was seen at a distance of eight miles. A good harbor
was found on the north side of the large island. All
the islands were covered with trees, but these were so low
and slender that timber available for yards was not to be
found. On his venturesome wanderings here, only now
and then accompanied by a Cossack, Steller penetrated
these woods, where he discovered a cellar, which contained
articles of food and various implements. As some
of these things were sent on board, Bering, by way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
indemnification, caused to be placed there an iron kettle,
a pound of tobacco, a Chinese pipe, and a piece of
silk cloth.</p>

BERING'S PLACE OF LANDING ON THE AMERICAN COAST.&mdash;CAPTAIN
COOK'S UNCERTAINTY.&mdash;THE QUESTION
DISCUSSED AND DEFINITELY SETTLED.</h3>


<p>In geographical literature complete uncertainty in
regard to Bering's island St. Elias and its situation
off the American coast still prevails. This uncertainty is
due partly to M&uuml;ller and partly to Cook. M&uuml;ller is
inaccurate; in fact, confused. He says that Bering saw
the American continent in a latitude of 58&deg; 28', and at
a difference of longitude from Avacha of 50&deg; (in reality,
58&deg; 14' and 56&deg; 30'), but he gives neither the latitude
nor longitude of the island of St. Elias, which is the
important point, and on his map of 1758, where he goes
into details more than in his description, he marked on
latitude 58&deg; 28': "<i>Coast discovered by Bering in 1741.</i>"
On such vague reports nothing can be based. In the
ship's journal, however, which M&uuml;ller in all likelihood
must have seen, the latitude of the island is entered as
59&deg; 40', and the longitude, according to the ship's
calculations, as 48&deg; 50' east of Avacha. But as Bering's
calculations, on account of the strong current, which in
these waters flows at a rate of twenty miles, had an
error of about 8&deg;, the longitude becomes 56&deg; 30' east of
Avacha, and at this astronomical point, approximately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
correct, lies Kayak Island, which is Cook's Kayes Island,
having a latitude of 59&deg; 47' and a longitude of 56&deg; 44'
east of Avacha, and hence the question is to prove that
this island really is the Guanahani of the Russians, that
is, St. Elias.</p>

<p>Cook is the authority for the opinion which has
hitherto prevailed; but surely no one can be more
uncertain and cautious on this point than he. He says:
"M&uuml;ller's report of the voyage is so abbreviated, and his
map is so extremely inaccurate, that it is scarcely possible
from the one or the other, or by comparing both, to
point out a single place that this navigator either saw or
landed on. If I were to venture an opinion on Bering's
voyage along this coast, I should say that he sighted land
in the vicinity of Mt. Fairweather. But I am in no way
certain that the bay which I named in his honor is the
place where he anchored. Nor do I know whether the
mountain which I called Mt. St. Elias is the same
conspicuous peak to which he gave this name, and I am
entirely unable to locate his Cape St. Elias."</p>

<p>It would seem that such uncertain and reserved opinions
were scarcely liable to be repeated without comment
or criticism. But nevertheless, the few reminiscences of
this chapter of Bering's explorations which our present
geography has preserved are obtained principally from
Cook's map; for the first successors of this great
navigator, Dixon, 1785, La P&eacute;rouse, 1786, Malespina,
1791, and Vancouver, 1792, through whose efforts the
northwest coast was scientifically charted, maintained,
with a few unimportant changes, Cook's views on this
point. According to these views, Bering Bay was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
59&deg; 18' north latitude and 139&deg; west longitude, but Cook
had not himself explored this bay; he had simply found
indications of a bay, and hence La P&eacute;rouse and
Vancouver, whose explorations were much more in
detail, and who at this place could find no bay, were
obliged to seek elsewhere for it. La P&eacute;rouse puts Bering
Bay 10' farther south, at the present Alsekh River,
northwest of Mt. Fairweather, the lagoon-shaped mouth
of which he calls <i>Rivi&egrave;re de Bering</i>, and Vancouver was
of the opinion that in La P&eacute;rouse's <i>Bay de Monti</i>,
Dixon's Admiralty Bay, 59&deg; 42' N. lat., he had found
Bering's place of landing. Vancouver's opinion has
hitherto held its own. The names Bering Bay, Admiralty
Bay, or, as the Russians call it, Yakutat, are found
side by side; the latter, however, is beginning to displace
the former, and properly so, for Bering was never in or
near this bay.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>While this Cook cartography fixed Bering's place of
landing too far east, the Russians committed the opposite
error. On the chart with which the Admiralty provided
Captain Billings on his great Pacific expedition, the
southern point of the Island of Montague, in Prince
William's Sound, (the Russian name of the island is
Chukli), is given as Bering's promontory St. Elias, and
the Admiralty gave him the right, as soon as the
expedition reached this point, to assume a higher military
rank, something which he actually did. But Admiral
Krusenstern, with his usual keenness, comes as near the
truth as it was possible without having Bering's own
chart and the ship's journal. He thinks that, according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>to Steller's narrative, the St. Peter must have touched
America farther west than Yakutat Bay, and considers
it quite probable that their anchoring place must be
sought at one of the passages leading into Controller
Bay, either between Cape Suckling (which on Russian
maps is sometimes called Cape St. Elias) and Point
Le Mesurier, or between the islands Kayak and
Wingham. We shall soon see that this last supposition
is correct. O. Peschel has not ventured wholly to accept
Krusenstern's opinion, but he nevertheless calls attention
to the fact that Bering Bay is not correctly located. He
fixes Bering's landing place west of Kayak Island, and
contends against considering Mt. St. Elias as the
promontory seen by Bering, something which would
seem quite superfluous.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>This uncertainty is all the more striking, as, from
the beginning of this century, there have been accessible,
in the works of Sauer and Sarycheff, facts enough to
establish the identity of the island of St. Elias with the
present Kayak Island, and since the publication of
Bering's own map, in 1851, by the Russian Admiralty,
there can no longer be a shadow of a doubt. The map
is found in the appendix of this work, and hence a
comparison between the islands of St. Elias and Kayak
is possible (Map IV). The astronomical situation of the
islands, their position with reference to the mainland,
their surroundings, coast-lines, and geographical extension,
the depths of the sea about both&mdash;everything proves
that they are identical; and, moreover, Sauer's and
Sarycheff's descriptions, which are quite independent of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>the St. Peter's journal, coincide exactly with the journal's
references to the island of St. Elias. Sauer says that the
island, from its most southerly point, extends in a northeasterly
direction ("trend north 46&deg; east"), that it is
twelve English miles long and two and a half miles
wide, that west of the island's most northerly point there
is a smaller island (Wingham), with various islets nearer
the mainland, by which a well-protected harbor is formed
behind a bar, with about seven feet of water at ebb-tide,&mdash;hence
just at the place where Khitroff, as we have
already seen, found an available harbor for the St. Peter.
The journal, as well as Steller, describes St. Elias as
mountainous, especially in the southern part, thickly
covered with low, coniferous trees, and Waxel particularly
mentions the fact that off the coast of the island's
southern point, Bering's Cape St. Elias, there was a
single cliff in the sea, a "kekur," which is also marked
on the map. Sarycheff and Sauer speak of Kayak Island
as mountainous and heavily timbered. Its southern
extremity rises above the rest of the island and ends very
abruptly in a naked, white, saddle-shaped mountain. A
solitary cliff of the same kind of rock, a pyramid-shaped
pillar ("kekur," "<i>Abspringer</i>") lies a few yards from
the point. Cook, too, in his fine outlines of Kayak
Island, puts this cliff directly south of the point. If we
then consider that the true dimensions of Bering's island
plainly point to Kayak, that his course along the new
coast is possible only on the same supposition that the
direction in which Bering from his anchorage saw Mt.
St. Elias exactly coincides with this mountain's position
with reference to Kayak, that the soundings given by him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
agree with those of Kayak, but do not agree with those
of Montague Island, which is surrounded by far more
considerable depths that have none of the above described
characteristics, and which, moreover, has so great a
circumference that Khitroff could not possibly have circumnavigated
it in twelve hours, and finally, considering
the fact that everything which Steller gives as
signs that a large current debouched near his anchorage
finds an obvious explanation in the great Copper
or Atna estuary, in 60&deg; 17' N., then it will be difficult
to resist the conviction that <i>Kayak is Bering's
St. Elias, and that Vancouver's Cape Hammond is his
Cape St. Elias</i>.</p>

<p>Moreover, the traditions of the natives corroborate
this conclusion. While Billings's expedition was in Prince
William's Sound, says Sauer, an old man came on board
and related that every summer his tribe went on hunting
expeditions to Kayak.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Many years before, while he was
a boy, the first ship came to the island and anchored
close to its western coast. A boat was sent ashore, but
when it approached land all the natives fled, and not
until the ship had disappeared did they return to their
huts, where in their underground store-rooms they found
some beads, leaves (tobacco), an iron kettle, and some
other things. Sarycheff gives an account of this meeting,
which in the main agrees with Billings's. These
stories also agree with Steller's account.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>These facts have not before, so far as the author
knows, been linked together, but Sokoloff states, without
proof, however, that Bering's landfall was Kayak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>Island.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> This correct view is now beginning to find its
way into American maps, where, in the latest works,
Cape St. Elias will be found in the proper place, together
with a Bering Haven on the northern coast of Kayak.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

of Vancouver) was the point of Bering's discovery, but Admiral Sarycheff,
who examined the journals of the expedition, pointed at once to
Kayak Island as the only point to which the description of Bering and
Steller could apply. Sarycheff made one mistake in applying the name of
Cape St. Elias to the nearest point of the mainland called Cape Suckling by
Cook."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tr.</span></p></div>

EXPLORATIONS ALONG THE AMERICAN COAST.&mdash;STELLER'S
CENSURE OF BERING FOR UNDUE HASTE.&mdash;BERING
DEFENDED.&mdash;DALL, THE AMERICAN WRITER, REPRIMANDED.&mdash;THE
RETURN VOYAGE.</h3>


<p>It is by no means an easy matter to form an unbiased
opinion of Bering's stay off Kayak Island. Steller
is about our only authority, but just at the point where
it is most difficult to supplement his account, he gives
vent to most violent accusations against the management
of the expedition from a scientific standpoint. On the
16th of July, when land was first seen, he says: "One
can easily imagine how happy all were to see land. No
one failed to congratulate Bering, as chief of the expedition,
to whom above all others the honor of discovery
belonged. Bering, however, heard all this, not only with
great indifference, but, looking toward land, he even
shrugged his shoulders in the presence of all on board."
Steller adds that on account of this conduct charges
might have been preferred against him in St. Petersburg,
had he lived.</p>

<p>As Bering during the first few succeeding days did not
make any preparations for a scientific exploration of the
country, as he even tried, according to Steller's assurance,
to dissuade the latter from making the island a visit, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
as Steller only through a series of oaths and threats (for
thus p. 30 must undoubtedly be interpreted) could obtain
permission to make, without help or even a guard for protection,
a short stay on the island, his anger grew to rage,
which reached its culmination on the following morning
when Bering suddenly gave orders that the St. Peter
should leave the island. "The only reason for this," he
says, "was stupid obstinacy, fear of a handful of natives,
and pusillanimous homesickness. For ten years Bering
had equipped himself for this great enterprise; the explorations
lasted ten hours!" Elsewhere he says derisively
that they had gone to the New World "simply to bring
American water to Asia."</p>

<p>These accusations must seem very serious to every
modern reader. Unfortunately for Bering, his second
voyage is of interest principally from the standpoint of
natural history. It is especially naturalists that have
studied it. They are predisposed to uphold Steller.
Hence his account threatens wholly to undermine Bering's
reputation, and as a matter of course, W. H. Dall, in discussing
this subject, finds opportunity to heap abuse upon
Bering. He says: "On the 18th of July, Bering saw
land. On the 20th he anchored under an island. Between
two capes, which he called St. Elias and St. Hermogenes,
was a bay where two boats were sent for water and to reconnoitre.
* * * With characteristic imbecility, Bering
resolved to put to sea again on the next day, the 21st of
July. Sailing to the northward, the commander was
confused among the various islands, and sailed hither
and thither, occasionally landing, but making no explorations,
and showing his total incapacity for the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
he occupied. He took to his bed, and Lieutenant Waxel
assumed charge of the vessel."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>This is not writing history. It is only a series of errors
and incivilities. It was <i>not</i> the 18th of July that Bering
first saw land. He did <i>not</i> sail north from Kayak, but
southwest, and hence could not have lost his course
among islands, for here there are no islands. Nor did he
sail hither and thither, but kept the course that had
been laid out, and charted the coasts he saw in this
course. The most ridiculous part of this is what this
nautical author tells of the bay between Cape St. Elias
and Cape St. Hermogenes (Marmot Island off the coast
of Kadiak Island), for these points are farther apart
than Copenhagen and Bremen. If, according to this
writer, Bering was unpardonably stupid, he must have
been, on the other hand, astonishingly "far-sighted."
After these statements it will surprise no one that this
author considers illness a kind of crime, and blames a
patient, sixty years of age, suffering with the scurvy,
for taking to his bed! If Mr. Dall had taken the trouble
to study the Bering literature to which he himself refers
in his bibliography of Alaska, he would have been in a
position to pass an independent opinion of the navigator,
and would certainly have escaped making this series of
stupid statements. His words now simply serve to show
how difficult it is to eradicate prejudice, and how tenacious
of life a false or biased judgment can be. Death
prevented Bering from defending and explaining his
conduct. No one has since that time sought to render
him justice. I therefore consider it my duty&mdash;even if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>I should seem to be yielding to the biographer's besetting
sin&mdash;to produce everything that can be said in
Bering's defense.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, it must be remembered that
on the 21st of July Bering had provisions left for no more
than three months, and that these were not good and
wholesome. His crew, and he himself, were already suffering
from scurvy to such an extent that two weeks later
one-third of them were on the sick-list. Furthermore,
he was over fifty-six degrees of longitude from his nearest
port of refuge, with a crew but little accustomed to the
sea. The American coast in that latitude was not,
according to Bering's judgment, nor is it according to our
present knowledge, in any way a fit place to winter, and
besides, he knew neither the sea nor its islands and depths,
its currents and prevailing winds. All this could not but
urge him to make no delay. And, in fact, Steller himself
expressly says that it was a series of such considerations
that determined Bering's conduct. "Pusillanimous
homesickness" can scarcely have had any influence on
a man who from his youth had roamed about in the
world and lived half a generation in the wilds of Siberia.
"The good Commander," thus Steller expresses himself,
"was far superior to all the other officers in divining
the future, and in the cabin he once said to myself
and Mr. Plenisner: 'We think now that we have found
everything, and many are pregnant with great expectations;
but they do not consider where we have landed,
how far we are from home, and what yet may befall us.
Who knows but what we may meet trade winds that
will prevent our return? We are unacquainted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
country, and are unprovided with provisions for wintering
here.'"</p>

<p>It must be conceded that his position was one fraught
with difficulties. At this point there are two things which
Steller either has not correctly understood, or suppresses.
According to his instructions, Bering was authorized to
spend two years and make two voyages in the discovery
of America, and to undertake another expedition afterwards
with new preparations and equipments. And in his
explanations to the crew he calls special attention to this
point. Under these circumstances it would not have been
right in him to assume any more risks than absolutely
necessary. But here again the old opposition between
Bering's nautico-geographical and Steller's physico-geographical
interests breaks out. As a discoverer of the old
school Bering's principal object was to determine some
elementary geographical facts: namely, the distribution
of land and water along the new coast, and hence he left
Kayak Island, not to reach Avacha as soon as possible,
but to follow the coast of the newly discovered country
toward the west and north. All authorities agree on this
point. It was illness and the Aliaska peninsula, projecting
so far into the ocean as it does, that prevented him
from sailing up toward latitude 65&deg;, his real goal. Even
Steller testifies to this, and although he repeats his former
accusations against Bering, it does not signify anything,
as he was excluded from the councils and was obliged to
guess at what was adopted. His accusations are especially
insignificant from the fact that he definitely contradicts
himself on this point, for later on in his narrative he says
that not until the 11th of August was it resolved, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
account of the approaching autumn and the great distance
from home, to start immediately on the return voyage
to Kamchatka. That is to say, they had not then
made a start. Until the 11th of August, for three weeks
after their departure from Kayak, Bering pursued his
task of nautical discovery along the new coast, and it
would seem that he can be blamed for nothing more than
considering this work of the expedition more important
than that of the physico-geographical investigation which
Steller represented. This was but natural. It was merely
accidental that Steller accompanied Bering, and through
him the expedition received a modern cast, which was not
at all designed, and which Bering desired to make use of
only under favorable circumstances. We may regret his
haste, and we may especially regret the fact that so keen
and clever a naturalist as Steller did not get an opportunity
to explore the regions west of Mount St. Elias before
European trade and white adventurers put in an appearance;
but it hardly seems a question of doubt whether
anyone for that reason has a right to make accusations
against the chief of the expedition.</p>

<p>It was very early on the morning of July 21 that the
chief suddenly, and contrary to his custom, appeared on
deck and gave the command to weigh anchor and stand
out to sea. In doing this he set aside his instructions
from headquarters to act in accordance with the ship's
council. He acted as a sovereign chief, and notwithstanding
the fact that both of his lieutenants thought it
wrong to leave the newly discovered coast without an
adequate supply of water, he overruled all objections
and informed them that he assumed all responsibility for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
his conduct. He was convinced of the entire necessity
of it, he said, and thought it unsafe to remain longer in
this exposed anchorage. Time did not permit him to go
in search of the harbor found by Khitroff on the day
previous, and there was moreover a seaward breeze. One
fourth of the water-casks remained unfilled.</p>

<p>Before a strong east wind, the St. Peter on that day
made fifty miles on a southwesterly course. During
the two succeeding days, he continued in this general
direction. It was misty, and the coast was invisible, but
the sounding-line continued to show a depth of from
forty to fifty fathoms. In a council, concerning the
deliberations of which Steller has a very confused and
incorrect account, it was decided, on July 25, to sail
slowly towards Petropavlovsk and, at intervals as wind
and weather permitted, to head for the north and west, in
order to explore the coast they had left.</p>

<p>They continued on their southwesterly course, and on
the next morning, July 26, they were off the Kadiak
archipelago. In a latitude of 66&deg; 30', and about sixteen
miles toward the north, they saw a high and projecting
point, which Bering called St. Hermogenes, in honor of
the patron saint of the day. He thought that this point
was a continuation of the continent they had left behind
them, and as such it is represented on both M&uuml;ller's and
Krasilnikoff's manuscript maps in the archives of the
Admiralty. On his third voyage, Cook explored the
Kadiak group, which he too had assumed to be a part of
the mainland. He now found that Bering's promontory
was a small island east of Afognak, but out of respect for
Bering, he retained the original name. Krusenstern also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
calls it St. Hermogenes Island, but later the Russians
changed it to Euratchey Island, on account of the great
number of marmots there, and since the United. States
came into possession of it, the name has been translated,
and it is now known as Marmot Island.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Steller has not
a single word in his diary about St. Hermogenes, and
besides, his account at this point is full of inaccuracies.</p>

<p>"Consequently, until July 26," he says, "we sailed
along the coast, as these gentlemen thought it was
necessary to follow it, while it would have been sufficient,
at intervals of a hundred versts, to have sailed a degree or
two toward the north." He thus blames them for not
having followed the method which at about that time
they had agreed upon, and later did follow. His story
of their having, for the first five days, sailed along the
coast, simply proves, in connection with a series of other
incidents in his work, that things were not entered in his
diary daily, but written down later from memory; hence
its value as proof is considerably diminished.</p>

<p>Along the southeastern coast of Kadiak the voyage
was very dangerous. The average depth was twenty-five
fathoms; the water was very roily, the weather heavy with
fog and rain, and the wind violent. Not until the 31st
of July was the weather clear enough for an observation,
when they found themselves in a latitude of 54&deg; 49', and
had passed the Kadiak archipelago.</p>

<p>In accordance with the plan adopted, they here veered
to the northwest to seek the mainland for the purpose of
determining its trend. On the night of August 1 (and 2),
they suddenly approached land, having only four fathoms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>of water below the keel. There was a heavy fog, no wind,
and a swift current, but they succeeded in shifting about
and getting out into eighteen fathoms of water, where
they anchored to await daybreak. In the morning, at
eight o'clock, a small island was seen at a distance of four
miles. It was three miles long, with an east to west
trend. A long reef extended out into the sea from the
eastern point, seen by them in a direction E. S. E. by E.
In the evening they weighed anchor, having a heavy fog,
and on the next morning, the island was seen at a distance
of seven geographical miles toward the south. Its
latitude was calculated as 55&deg; 32', but as all of Bering's
determinations of latitude on his return voyage from
America show an error of from 30' to 45' less than the
true latitude, it must be concluded that the island was
in latitude 56&deg; and some minutes. He called the island
St. Stephen from the calendar day, but his crew or
lieutenants must have called it Foggy Island (Tumannoi),
as even Krasilnikoff's manuscript map, in the possession
of the Admiralty, has this name. Later the cartography
of this region became considerably confused. The name
St. Stephen disappeared. Cook called another island Fog
Island, while it became customary to consider the island
discovered by Bering as identical with Ukamok (Chirikoff
Island, Vancouver's Island), where the Russians had
a colony, and thus the island itself was finally lost to
geography. Notwithstanding the fact that Admiral
Krusenstern, in a clever essay, has given an able
review of the literature pertaining to this question,
and has shown that where Bering saw St. Stephen,
Cook, Sarycheff, and Vancouver likewise saw an island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
different from Ukamok, and regardless of the fact that
for these reasons he restored St. Stephen on his map,
Lieutenant Sokoloff, who most recently, in Russian
literature, has treated Bering's voyage to America, has
wholly disregarded Krusenstern's essay, and says that
St. Stephen is identical with Ukamok. Sokoloff's essay
is very superficial, and, compared with Krusenstern's
weighty reasons, is based on mere supposition. But,
although the map of the North Pacific, in the Russian
Admiralty (1844), has a Tumannoi Island (that is, Foggy
Island, St. Stephen) somewhat northeast of Ukamok, it
must be admitted that, until the United States undertakes
a new and careful survey of the Aliaska peninsula
and its southern surroundings, this question can not be
thoroughly decided, probable as it may be that Bering
and Krusenstern are both right.</p>

<p>August 3, the voyage was continued toward the northwest.
In a latitude of 56&deg; (according to Steller) they
saw the high snow-capped mountain peaks of the Aliaska
peninsula in a direction N. N. W. by W., but on account
of stormy and foggy weather they sought, with an easterly
wind, to get back into their main course. Thus they
reached, August 4, the Jefdokjejefski Islands in a direction
S. S. E. &frac34; by E., at a distance of twenty miles from
55&deg; 45' N. These form a group of seven high and rocky
islands, which on Russian maps still bears the same name,
but in West Europe this name has been displaced, and
they are usually called the Semidi, or Semidin, Islands,
the name of the largest of the group.</p>

<p>On August 7, they found themselves south of the
Jefdokjejefski Islands. But now misfortunes began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
pour in upon them. They encountered adverse winds
which continued with but few interruptions during the
succeeding months. The St. Peter was tossed about on
the turbulent and unfamiliar waters of the Aleutian archipelago,
where the crew experienced an adventure so
fraught with suffering and dire events that it is quite
beyond compare in the history of discoveries. At the
same time, the scurvy got the upper hand. Bering had
a severe attack which rendered him unfit for service.
With his illness the bonds of discipline were relaxed.
Under these circumstances there was called, on the 10th
of August, an extraordinary council, in which all the
officers participated. At this meeting it was finally
decided to give up the charting of the American coast,
and immediately start out upon the direct route homeward
on parallel 52&deg;, the latitude of Avacha. The
whole crew, from the highest to the lowest, signed this
resolution. The facts taken into consideration were that
September had been fixed as the extreme limit of time
within which to return home, and that they were then
in the middle of August. Avacha was at least 1600
miles distant, autumn was at hand with dark nights
and stormy weather, and sixteen of the crew were
already sick with the scurvy.</p>

<p>With a strong head-wind, in raw and foggy weather,
and now and then overtaken by fierce storms, they
worked their way slowly along until the 27th of August.
The condition of affairs on board had grown continually
worse, when it was finally announced that through carelessness
and irregularity the supply of water had been
reduced to twenty-five casks, a quantity that could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
possibly suffice for the 1200 miles which, according to
their calculations, yet remained. Hence it was necessary
once more to find land to take in water, and on the
27th the St. Peter's prow was again headed for Aliaska.
They sailed north one degree and a half, and after a
lapse of three days they reached a multitude of high
islands, behind which the coast of the mainland arose
in the distance.</p>

<p>August 30, the St. Peter lay at anchor off the Shumagins,
a group of thirteen treeless, barren, and rocky
islands near the coast of Aliaska. The journal gives their
situation as latitude 54&deg; 48' N. and longitude 35&deg; 30' E.
from Avacha. While the latitude as here determined
has the usual error, referred to several times before,
the longitude has an error of 6&frac12;&deg;. Among these islands
the first death on board occurred. It was the sailor
Shumagin, who, on the 30th, died in the hands of his
mates as they were taking him ashore. The islands
were named in honor of him. On the whole the situation
was most deplorable. Bering had fallen away so
much in his illness that he could not stand, and the
others that were sick were carried ashore, and lay scattered
along the coast, giving this a very sad and sorrowful
aspect. Confusion and uncertainty grew apace, as
those in command could not maintain their authority.
Waxel and Khitroff, the highest in command, bandied
words, whereas the situation demanded firmness and
vigor. The only one that preserved any manner of self-possession
and forethought was Steller. He immediately
went ashore, examined the vegetation of the island,
and collected a large number of anti-scorbutic plants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
especially scurvy-grass and berries, with which, in the
course of a week, he succeeded in restoring Bering to
sufficient strength to be able to use his limbs. Through
the use of the same remedies the other sufferers were
relieved. But Steller thought also of the future. The
medicine chest contained "plasters and salves for half
an army," but only extremely few real medicines, and
hence he suggested to Lieut. Waxel, who was then in
command, that he send a number of sailors ashore to
gather anti-scorbutic plants, but this excellent and
timely advice was rejected.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Steller used all his influence to procure
good water. He went ashore with the sailors for this
purpose, and as they began to dip water from the first
pool they found, one, too, which was connected with
the sea during high tide, he directed them to fresh
springs a little farther in the interior, but the crew sent
some samples on board, and from there came the report
that the water was good enough. Thus it was that a
new cause of disease&mdash;in spite of Steller's protestations&mdash;was
added to all the others. The water was brackish,
and on standing in the casks became unfit for use.</p>

<p>On the whole the stay at the Shumagins, which was
unnecessarily prolonged, was very unfortunate. The St.
Peter lay at anchor south of them in a very exposed position.
On the evening of August 29, a fire was seen on
one of the islands, and on this account, Khitroff wished
to explore them more thoroughly, although Waxel firmly
opposed releasing both of the ship's boats under the
present dangerous circumstances. By applying to Bering,
who was in the cabin, and hardly understood the situation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Khitroff had his way, and left the ship with the
yawl and five men. He was gone four days, during
which time the St. Peter was forced to lie at anchor,
while a favorable east wind might have carried them
several hundred miles toward home. The yawl was
dashed to pieces off one of the neighboring islands, and
no more came from the expedition than that Lieutenant
Waxel, under great difficulty, found it necessary to rescue
the six shipwrecked adventurers. Moreover, they
experienced a somewhat uninteresting clash with the
Innuit (Esquimo)<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> inhabitants of the Aliaska peninsula,
of which M&uuml;ller and Steller both give a detailed account.</p>

<p>The St. Peter left the Shumagin Islands September 6,
and sailed southward to resume the direct course.
The weather was very bad, with alternating fogs, mist, and
storms. A west wind prevailed almost continuously.
Now and then a regular hurricane crossed their course.
If occasionally they had a favorable breeze, it seemed to
last but a few hours. "I know no harder, more fatiguing
life," says one of the St. Peter's officers, "than to sail
an unknown sea. I speak from experience, and with
truth can say that during the five months I spent on this
voyage, without seeing any place of which the latitude
and longitude had been fixed, I did not have many hours
of quiet sleep. We were in constant danger and uncertainty."</p>

<p>As a last resort, they even thought of returning to
America, or of reaching Japan. For several days they
were swept along by a storm. September 23, the second
death occurred, and on the 24th they again saw, to their
great astonishment, land toward the north. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
then on about the 51st parallel. They were of the opinion
that they were fourteen degrees from the Shumagins, and
supposed that they were 21&deg; 39' from Avacha, which of
course was very erroneous, for they were in the vicinity
of the present Atka. As they saw behind the islands a
high, snow-capped mountain, which, from the calendar
day, they called St. Johannes, they supposed the land to
be a continuation of the American continent.</p>

<p>During the next seventeen days, from the 25th of
September until the 11th of October, they carried their
lower sails only, and were driven by a stormy west wind
five degrees toward the southeast to a latitude of 48&deg;.
"The wind," says Steller, "seemed as if it issued forth
from a flue, with such a whistling, roaring and rumbling,
that we expected every moment to lose mast and rudder,
or to see the ship crushed between the breakers. The
dashing of a heavy sea against the vessel sounded like
the report of a cannon, and even the old, experienced
mate, Andreas Hesselberg, assured us that during a
sailor's life of fifty years he had not before seen such a
sea." No one was able to stand at his post. The ship
was at the mercy of the angry elements. Half of the
crew were sick and feeble, the other half well from dire
necessity, but were confused and distracted by the great
danger. For many days no cooking could be done, and
all they had that was fit to eat was some burned ship-biscuits,
and even these were on the point of becoming
exhausted. No one showed any firmness of purpose;
their courage was as "unsteady as their teeth." The
officers now and then thought of returning to America,
but their plans changed as often as the weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>During the first week in October it became very cold;
heavy storms of hail and snow swept over the ship and
made the work on board almost unendurable. On the
6th the ship's supply of brandy gave out, and, as the
storm from the southwest still continued to rage, Waxel
seriously proposed to return to America and seek a harbor
of refuge, as it would be necessary in a few days, on
account of the number on the sick list, to resign the ship
to the mercy of the waves.</p>

<p>Bering, however, refused to entertain this idea, and
exhorted the crew to make an offering to the church&mdash;the
Russians to the church in Petropavlovsk, the Lutherans
to the church in Viborg, Finland, where Bering had
formerly resided.</p>

<p>As elsewhere on this whole voyage, Steller was here
geographically confused, and imagined that they were
sailing in a latitude of 50-53&deg;, while in reality they were
on the 48th parallel, and hence his complaint that the
officers would not sail to this parallel to get a better
breeze, signifies nothing. M&uuml;ller gives the correct position
of the ship when he says that on the 12th of October
it was in latitude 48&deg; 18', but he too is wrong when he
states that the weather did not permit them to make an
observation, for just at this time they had fair weather
and sunshine, and on the 11th, at noon, determined the
latitude as 48&deg; 15' and the longitude as 27&deg; east of
Avacha. During the succeeding ten days the weather
was somewhat more favorable. Clear weather, with heavy
frosts, prevailed; some hail and snow fell, but nevertheless
they succeeded in making ten degrees on the
parallel of 49&deg; 30'. The condition on board was getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
much worse. Poor water, lack of bread and spirits, the
cold and wet, vermin and anxiety, undermined the last
remnants of their powers of resistance. On the 19th the
grenadier Kisseloff, on the 20th the servant Charitonoff,
and on the 21st the soldier Luka Savjaloff, died. Even
men apparently well were unable to stand at their posts
from sheer want and exhaustion.</p>

<p>Then the water supply threatened to give out. They
had but fifteen casks of water, a part of which was very
poor. Waxel was again thinking of searching for land
toward the north, when a strong wind carried them so far
westward that they supposed they had passed all traces of
American regions. They then determined to keep their
course on the 52&deg; of latitude, but on the following day, to
their great astonishment, they sighted the Aleutian Islands
and made some new discoveries. On October 25, at
a distance of 8&frac12; geographical miles toward the northwest,
they saw a high, snow-capped island, which they called
St. Marcus. By an observation at noon its latitude was
found to be 50&deg; 50', but as this island is our Amchitka,
and as its southern extremity, according to Admiral Sarycheff,
is in a latitude of 51&deg; 35', it is evident that the St.
Peter's determinations of latitude were constantly from
one-half to three-fourths of a degree less than the true
latitude. Later this fact had an extremely unfortunate
effect on their resolutions. On October 28, Kiska, which
Bering called St. Stephen, was discovered, besides three
(in reality four) smaller islands east of it, and, carried
along toward the north by a southwesterly wind, they
sighted, on the morning of the 29th, some low islands,
which are supposed to have been the present Semichi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Islands, situated east of Attu. These islands, which to
them appeared as one, were called St. Abraham Island.
According to the ship's journal they were seen at ten
o'clock in the morning at a distance of six miles toward
the west, and at noon ten miles in a direction W. S. W.
It is evident that the St. Peter sailed north of these islands,
but as the latitude on that day was determined as
52&deg; 31', at least 45' too far south, and as the ship undoubtedly
on the 29th and 30th of October passed the Blizhni
group (the Nearer Aleutians) it is more than probable
that the strait between the most westerly of the Semichi
Islands and Attu was seen from the ship's deck, although
the officers do not mention this island in the journal, but
simply indicate it on the chart. It is, however, referred
to by both M&uuml;ller and Steller. The most westerly of the
Semichi Islands and Attu must be the former's Deception
Islands. Steller applies all of his acuteness of mind to
show that they were the first two Kuriles. Nothing shows
better than this assertion how confused Steller was;
hence his unsparing attacks on Waxel, and his base
insinuations, are not of the least moment. "Betrayed
and sold by two unscrupulous leaders," he says, "we
sailed, after October 31, in a northerly direction from the
51st to the 56th parallel!" How unreasonable! They
were, already on the 30th, north of the 53d parallel. A
sharp southwest wind was blowing, several deaths were
occurring daily, the helmsmen were conducted to the
wheel by companions so deathly sick that they could
scarcely walk, the ship's rigging and sails were fast giving
way, the weather was raw and damp, the nights dark and
long, and all attempts at the determination of latitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
and longitude had about ceased. Under these circumstances
was it not worthy of all honor that Waxel was still
able to hold the vessel up to the wind at all and approach
the Commander Islands from Attu? In a short time the
wind veered to the east, and on November 4 (Steller has
it the 5th), in a latitude calculated at 53&deg; 30', they saw
an elevated coast in the west at a distance of about sixteen
miles. It is impossible to describe the joy occasioned by
this sight. The sick and half-dead crawled on deck to
see land once more, and all thanked God for their merciful
rescue. Bering, almost completely exhausted, was
greatly revived, and all thought of how they would rest
and restore their health and vigor. Hidden brandy casks
were brought out, in order that by the Vodka's assistance
they might properly celebrate the happy return. And in
the first moments of their exultation even the officers
rejoiced to think that their calculations were not entirely
wrong.</p>

<p>All were agreed that they were off the mouth of Avacha
Bay, and in the precipitous mountain sides of Copper
Island they eagerly sought for the promontories which
mark the entrance to that bay. The channel between
Copper Island and Bering Island was hidden to their
view, hence they thought they had reached Kamchatka.
When, a little later, they saw through the mist the most
northerly part of the strait, they were for a short time not
indisposed to believe that they were near their home harbor.
But soon an intense feeling of doubt seized them.
According to the ship's reckoning, they were yet forty
miles from Avacha. An observation at noon informed
them they were at least one degree farther north than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
this place, and before evening came on, the coast-lines
assumed an appearance that compelled them to give up
all thought of having reached home. But, as Bering
on his first voyage had not found land for several days'
sailing east of the mouth of the Kamchatka River, they
still clung to the belief that they were off the coast of
the mainland. During the night, they stood to the
north so as to steer clear of land, as they feared a
storm. With great difficulty the topsails were taken in,
but the feeble crew were obliged to leave the other sails.
In the night a storm from the east rent the starboard
shrouds of the mainmast so that it could no longer
carry sail. The next morning, a bright and magnificent
November day, the whole crew assembled for a final
consultation.</p>

<p>All that could walk or crawl, officers as well as crew,
dragged themselves into the chief's cabin to hear the
result. I have repeatedly called attention to the fact
that Bering did not have the sovereign power with which
the chief of an expedition is now-a-days endowed. The
terrible disease that had overpowered him still further
lessened his influence; but never had the rules and
regulations appeared in worse light than on this occasion.
Waxel and Khitroff, who had resolved to make a landing,
sought both before and during the meeting to induce the
crew to vote for this resolution; but Bering opposed it
and put forth the last remnants of his strength and
energy to rescue the expedition. "We have still the
foremast," he said, "and six casks of water. After
having endured so much suffering and hardship, we must
risk everything in order to reach Avacha." Waxel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Khitroff immediately endeavored to counteract the influence
of this good advice, but the subordinates were in
doubt, and would not sign any resolution except on the condition
that the officers expressly assured them of the fact
that the adjacent coast was Kamchatka. This Khitroff
finally took upon himself to do, and so partly through
compulsion and partly through persuasion the lieutenants
succeeded in securing a majority for their proposition.
But even yet Bering sought to save his convictions, and
appealed to the reduced Lieutenant Ofzyn, who had had
charge of the explorations from the Obi to the Yenesei
and was now serving as a sailor on board the St. Peter;
but as he immediately expressed his agreement with
Bering, he was in most abusive language driven from
the cabin. Under these circumstances Steller found it
useless to support Bering. He confined himself to certifying
to the very great enervation of the crew. Before
the council adjourned, it was resolved to make for the
coast, where the lieutenants, in an open bay, expected to
find a harbor.</p>

<p>Before an easy northeast breeze, the St. Peter drifted
toward the coast, without helmsman or commander. The
chief lay at death's door in his cabin, Waxel and Khitroff
were seeking rest and quiet, and not until the ship lay
about four miles from land did Steller induce Bering to
order them on deck. They soon began to sound, and
one verst from shore they cast anchor. Night came on
with bright moonlight. The ebb-tide receded over the
rocky beach, producing heavy breakers. In these the
ship was tossed about like a ball, until finally the cable
snapped. They now expected to be dashed against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
rocks at any moment. The confusion became indescribable.
In order not to have a corpse on board, the dead
bodies of two of their companions were thrown overboard.
It had been the intention to take them ashore for
burial. At this juncture the second anchor was lost;
but at the last moment, just as the third was on the
point of being cast, Ofzyn succeeded in establishing order
and keeping the anchor on board. The vessel glided
safely across the reefs, and in a few moments the boatswain
and Ofzyn were able to anchor in a sheltered place.
The St. Peter was safe for the time being. In this still
and bright November night (the night of Nov. 6, 1741)
the ship was riding at anchor off the center of the northeast
coast of Bering Island, scarcely 600 yards from
shore. Thus ended this frightful adventure. Very
fortunately, the ship had happened to strike the only
navigable channel on the east that leads to the coast of
the island.</p>

<p>It yet remains to determine with more exactness the
place of stranding. On this point literature offers no
reliable information. I am aware that Steller says that
the vessel stranded on the northern coast of the island,
but this is not to be taken literally. After the St. Peter
had passed the northern point of Copper Island, which
lies parallel with the trend of Bering Island, it was carried
west and southwest by a northeasterly wind, and
hence would strike the coast of Bering Island off, or a
few minutes north of, the northern extremity of Copper
Island. At this point the eastern coast of Bering Island
recedes to the west and forms that bay which the officers
saw ahead. From this it is evident that the place where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the vessel ran ashore was four or five miles north of the
present Cape Khitroff. In Waxel's journal the geographical
position is entered as 55&deg; 5' north latitude, but Fr.
L&uuml;tke gives it as latitude 54&deg; 58' and longitude 193&deg; 23'
west from Greenwich. On his large map of a part of
the Aleutian Islands, with Russian and French text, he
marks the place of landing at this point with these words:
"<i>C'est pr&egrave;s de cet endroit que le commandeur Bering a
fait naufrage</i>"<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> (<i>i. e.</i>, in the vicinity of this place Bering
stranded). This place is at about the center of the
eastern coast of the island, which extends at least 28'
farther north to Cape Waxel, and hence only from a
local point of view, just as it must have seemed to Steller
as the vessel approached land, can this receding part of
the coast be designated as the northern side of the
island. The view here set forth is further corroborated
by many places in Steller's diary, and by other accounts
of the stay on the island.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The island upon whose shores Bering, after a voyage
of four months, was cast, was a high, rocky, and
uninviting country. The snowless mountains of Plutonic
rock, wild and jagged, arose perpendicularly out
of the sea, and deep ravines with seething mountain
streams led into the treeless interior.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> There was snow
on only the highest peaks, and on this cold November
night the coast appeared to the shipwrecked unfortunates
in all its naked and gloomy solitude, and hence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>great was their surprise on landing to find the island
teeming with animal life, yet undisturbed by human
habitation. The Commander Islands, as the group is
now called, consist of two large islands and a few rocky
islets. The most easterly of the former is Copper Island
(Mednie), about thirty-five miles long and three miles
wide, covered with high, steep, and jagged mountains,
which lie athwart the main trend of the island, S. E.
to N. W., and terminate precipitously, often perpendicularly,
with a narrow strand at the base scarcely
fifty feet wide. On a somewhat larger scale, the same
description applies to Bering Island, which, according
to Steller, is 23&frac12; geographical miles long and nearly 3&frac14;
wide. It is situated about 30 geographical miles from
Kamchatka, between latitude 54&deg; 40' and 55&deg; 25' north,
and longitude 165&deg; 40' and 166&deg; 40' east of Greenwich.
Only on the west coast, within the shelter of the Sea
Lion Island (Arii Kamen) and a lesser islet, is there a
fairly good harbor, where the Russians later founded
the only colony of the island, consisting of a few Aleuts
who cultivate some vegetables, but maintain themselves
principally by hunting and fishing. For this purpose
they have built, here and there on the east coast, some
earth-huts which are used only temporarily. The very
high mountains, having a trend from N. W. to S. E., almost
everywhere extend clear to the sea, and only here and
there along the mouths of the brooks do semicircular
coves recede from 700 to 1300 yards into the interior.
In Bering's day these coves or rookeries contained a
fauna entirely unmolested by human greed and love of
chase, developed according to nature's own laws, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
which reason great scientific interest attaches to the
stranding of the St. Peter. Of this animal life Steller
gives us in his various works descriptions which are unexcelled
in power and fidelity. These have made Bering's
second voyage immortal. Naturalists will again and again
turn to them. For this reason it would seem that Steller
had no ground for complaint that Bering had taken him
from his real field of investigation: Kamchatka&mdash;a complaint
made in our day by O. Peschel&mdash;for on Bering
Island he first found that field of labor and that material,
the description of which has immortalized his name.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i177.jpg" width="400" height="382" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>STELLER'S TRIUMPHAL ARCH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>With the exception of the Arctic fox, the higher
fauna of these islands were found exclusively among
the sea mammals. The most important furred animal
at that time was the sea-otter (<i>Enhydra lutris</i>, Linn.),
which lived in families on the coast during the whole
year, especially, however, in the winter. Its velvety fur
brought about 100 rubles on the Chinese border, and
hence this animal later became the object of a most eager
search. Nordenskj&ouml;ld says these otters have been driven
away, not only from Bering Island, but also from other
grounds, where formerly they were slaughtered by the
thousand. This statement, however, is not entirely correct.
The sea-otter may still be found on Bering Island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and on the adjacent Copper Island (Mednie) it is frequently
found, and is protected by just such laws as Nordenskj&ouml;ld
demands for its preservation.</p>

<p>The greatest number of marine animals here were
found to belong to the family of eared seals (<i>Otariid&oelig;</i>);
namely, the sea-lion (<i>Eumetopias Stelleri</i>), from which
oil is obtained, and the fur-seal (<i>Callorhinus ursinus</i>),
which is still the world's most important fur-bearing animal.
Since the close of the last century, the Russian government
has with great care sought to protect this animal,
and has built up a national enterprise which yields a large
annual income, and which makes it possible for the Russo-American
company which has a lease of the business, to
kill annually about 30,000 seals and still increase the stock.
On this point, too, Nordenskj&ouml;ld's statements are unreliable
and misleading. He puts the annual catch much too
high, which, at the time, caused no slight trouble between
the Russian government and the company.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>On the whole, it seems humiliating to West Europe
that it is only decried and tyrannical Russia that has
understood how to protect this useful animal. When
Russian America, the present Alaska, in 1867 was sold
to the United States, some of the best seal fisheries, the
Pribyloff Islands, were a part of the purchase. The
United States has found it profitable to retain the Russian
regulations for seal hunting, for those small islands
alone yield the interest on the sum paid for the whole
territory.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>
<p>The eared seals put in their appearance on the Commander
Islands in the spring, and are found in the rookeries
by the hundreds of thousands until August or September.
They proved of the greatest importance for the
support of the shipwrecked expedition, and after the sea-otter
for a circuit of many miles had been driven away,
they furnished a part of the crew's daily means of
sustenance.</p>

<p>But the most interesting animal on Bering Island
was the sea-cow (<i>Rhytina Stelleri</i>),<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> a very large and
ponderous animal from eight to ten meters long and
weighing about three tons. It was related to the
dugong and lamantine of the southern seas, and the
<i>manatus</i> which occurs in Florida and along the Gulf
coast. Its habitat seems to have been confined to the
shores of the Commander Islands, where it was found
in great numbers. Its flesh was very excellent food.
Later it was eagerly sought after by the Siberian
hunter, whose rapacity exterminated the whole species
in less than a generation. The last specimen is said
to have been killed in 1768, and hence museums have
been very unsuccessful in procuring skeletons of the
animal. In his "Voyage of the Vega," Nordenskj&ouml;ld
attempts to show that sea-cows were seen much later,
even as late as 1854; but as he bases his assumption
chiefly on the statements of some Aleutian natives,
who, according to what Dr. Leonhard Stejneger recently
has proved, confounded the sea-cow with a
toothed whale (denticete), there seems to be no reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>whatever for modifying the results arrived at by Baer,
Brandt, and Middendorff.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Without this animal wealth it would have gone hard
with Bering's expedition as it did later with the unfortunate
La P&eacute;rouse, whose monument has found a
place in Petropavlovsk by the side of Bering's. It
would have been hopelessly lost on Bering Island.
None of the participants would have seen Asia again,
none would even have survived the winter 1741-42,
for when the St. Peter stranded, there were on board
only a few barrels of junk, a small quantity of groats,
and some flour. The flour had been lying in leathern
sacks for two years, and in the stranding had been
saturated with turbid sea water, and hence was very
unfit for food. How fatal, therefore, Waxel's and
Khitroff's opposition to Bering might have been.</p>

<p>It was the night between the 5th and 6th of November
that the St. Peter reached this coast. On the
6th the weather was calm and clear, but the crew
were kept on board from weakness and work, and
only Steller and Pleniser could go ashore with a few
of the sick. They immediately betook themselves to
examining the country, and walked along the coast
on either side. Was this an island, or was it the
mainland? Could they expect to find human assistance,
and could they reach home by land? After two
days of exploration, Steller succeeded in satisfying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>himself on these points, although it was nearly six
months before he definitely ascertained that the place
was an island. Unlike Kamchatka, the country was
treeless, having only a few trailing willows of the
thickness of a finger. The animals of the coast were
entirely new and strange, even to him, and showed
no fear whatever. They had no sooner left the ship,
when they saw sea-otters, which they first supposed
to be bears or gluttons. Arctic foxes flocked about
them in such numbers that they could strike down
three or four score of them in a couple of hours.
The most valuable fur-bearing animals stared at them
curiously, and along the coast Steller saw with wonderment
whole herds of sea-cows grazing on the luxuriant
alg&aelig; of the strand. Not only he had never seen
this animal before, but even his Kamchatkan Cossack
did not know it. From this fact, Steller concluded
that the island must be uninhabited. As the trend
of Kamchatka was not the same as that of the island,
and as the flora was nevertheless identical, and as he
moreover found a window frame of Russian workmanship
that had been washed ashore, he was convinced
that the country must be a hitherto unknown island
in the vicinity of Kamchatka.</p>

<p>Bering shared this view, but the other officers still
clung to their illusions, and when Waxel, on the evening
of the 6th, came ashore, he even spoke of sending
a message for conveyance. Steller, on the other
hand, began to make preparations for the winter. In
the sand-banks, near an adjacent mountain stream, he
and his companions dug a pit and made a roof of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
driftwood and articles of clothing. To cover up cracks
and crevices on the sides, they piled up the foxes they
had killed. He exerted himself to obtain wild fowl,
seal-beef, and vegetable nourishment for the sick, who
were gradually taken ashore and placed under sail
tents upon the beach. Their condition was terrible.
Some died on deck as soon as they were removed from
the close air of their berths, others in the boat as
they were being taken ashore, and still others on the
coast itself. All attempts at discipline were abandoned,
and those that were well grouped themselves
into small companies, according to their own pleasure
and agreement. The sick and dying were seen on
every hand. Some complained of the cold, others of
hunger and thirst, and the majority of them were so
afflicted with scurvy that their gums, like a dark
brown sponge, grew over and entirely covered the teeth.
The dead, before they could be buried, were devoured
by foxes, which in countless numbers flocked about,
not even fearing to attack the sick.</p>

<p>More than a week elapsed before the last of the
sick were taken ashore. On November 10, the Commander
was removed. He was well protected against
the influence of the outer air, and was laid for the
night under a tent on the strand. It snowed heavily.
Steller passed the evening with him and marveled at
his cheerfulness and his singular contentment. They
weighed the situation, and discussed the probability of
their whereabouts. Bering was no more inclined than
Steller to think that they had reached Kamchatka, or
that their ship could be saved. The next day he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
carried on a stretcher to the sand pits and placed in
one of the huts by the side of Steller's. The few
that were able to work sought to construct huts for
all. Driftwood was collected, pits were dug and roofed,
and provisions were brought from the ship. Steller
was both cook and physician&mdash;the soul of the enterprise.
On November 13, the barrack to be used as
a hospital was completed, and thither the sick were
immediately removed. But still the misery kept increasing.
Steller had already given up all hopes of
Bering's recovery. Waxel, who had been able to keep
up as long as they were on the sea, now hovered
between life and death. There was special anxiety
on account of his low condition, as he was the only
competent seaman that still had any influence, since
Khitroff, by his hot and impetuous temper, had incurred
the hatred of all. Moreover, those sent to
reconnoiter, returned with the news that in a westerly
direction they could find no connection with Kamchatka
or discover the slightest trace of human habitation.
It became stormy; for several days the boat
could not venture out, and the ship, their only hope,
lay very much exposed near a rocky shore. The
anchor was not a very good one, and there was great
danger that the vessel would be driven out to sea,
or be dashed to pieces on the rocks. The ten or
twelve able-bodied men that were left, being obliged
to stand in icy water half a day at a time, soon gave
way under such burdens. Sickness and want were
on every hand. Despair stared them in the face, and
not until November 25, when the vessel was driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
clear ashore and its keel buried deep in the sand, did
their condition seem more secure. They then went
quietly to work to prepare for the winter.</p>

<p>In December the whole crew was lodged in five underground
huts (dug-outs) on the bank of the stream near
the place of landing.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The ship's provisions were divided
in such a way that every man daily received a pound of
flour and some groats, until the supply was exhausted.
But they had to depend principally upon the chase, and
subsisted almost exclusively upon the above mentioned
marine animals and a stranded whale. Each hut constituted
a family with its own economical affairs, and daily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>sent out one party to hunt and another to carry wood
from the strand. In this way they succeeded in struggling
through the winter, which on Bering Island is more characterized
by raging snowstorms (poorgas) than severe cold.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, death made sad havoc among them. Before
they reached Bering Island, their dead numbered twelve,
the majority of whom died during the last days of the
voyage. During the landing and immediately afterwards
nine more were carried away. The next death did not
occur until November 22. It was the excellent and
worthy mate, the seventy-year-old Andreas Hesselberg,
who had plowed the sea for fifty years, and whose advice,
had it been heeded, would have saved the expedition.
Then came no less than six deaths in rapid succession;
and finally in December the Commander and another
officer died. The last death occurred January 6, 1742.
In all, thirty-one men out of seventy-seven died on this
ill-starred expedition.</p>

<p>When Bering exerted his last powers to prevent the
stranding of the St. Peter, he struggled for life. Before
leaving Okhotsk he had contracted a malignant ague,
which diminished his powers of resistance, and on the
voyage to America scurvy was added to this. His sixty
years of age, his heavy build, the trials and tribulations
he had experienced, his subdued courage, and his disposition
to quiet and inactivity, all tended to aggravate this
disease; but he would nevertheless, says Steller, without
doubt have recovered if he had gotten back to Avacha,
where he could have obtained proper nourishment and
enjoyed the comfort of a warm room. In a sandpit on
the coast of Bering Island, his condition was hopeless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
For blubber, the only medicine at hand, he had an unconquerable
loathing. Nor were the frightful sufferings
he saw about him, his chagrin caused by the fate of the
expedition, and his anxiety for the future of his men, at
all calculated to check his disease. From hunger, cold,
and grief he slowly pined away. "He was, so to speak,
buried alive. The sand kept continually rolling down
upon him from the sides of the pit and covered his feet.
At first this was removed, but finally he asked that it
might remain, as it furnished him with a little of the
warmth he so sorely needed. Soon half of his body
was under the sand, so that after his death, his comrades
had to exhume him to give him a decent burial."
He died on the 8th<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> of December, 1741, two hours before
daybreak, from inflammation of the bowels.</p>

<p>"Sad as his death was," says Steller, "that intrepidity
and seriousness with which he prepared to meet
death was most worthy of admiration." He thanked
God for having been his guide from youth, and for
having given him success through life. He sought in
every way possible to encourage his companions in misfortune
to hopeful activity, and inspire them with faith
in Providence and the future. Notwithstanding his conviction
that they had been cast upon the shores of an
unknown land, he was not disposed to discourage the
others by expressing himself on this point. On the 9th
of December his body was interred in the vicinity of
the huts, between the graves of the second mate and
the steward. At the departure from the island there
was placed upon his grave a plain wooden cross, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>also served to show that the island belonged to the
Russian crown. This cross was renewed several times,
and in the sixties, so far as is known, twenty-four men
erected a monument to his honor in the governor's garden
(the old churchyard) in Petropavlovsk, where a monument
to the unfortunate La P&eacute;rouse is also found, and
where Cook's successor, Captain Clerke, found his last
resting place.</p>

<p>With Bering that mental power, which had been the
life of these great geographical expeditions and driven
them forward toward their goal, was gone. We have seen
how his plans were conceived; how through long and
dreary years he struggled in Siberia to combine and execute
plans and purposes which only under the greatest
difficulties could be combined and executed; how by his
quiet and persistent activity he endeavored to bridge the
chasm between means and measures, between ability to
do and a will to do,&mdash;a condition typical of the Russian
society of that time. We have seen how he surmounted
the obstacles presented by a far-off and unwilling government,
a severe climate, poor assistants, and an inexperienced
force of men. We have accompanied him on his
last expedition, which seems like the closing scene of a
tragedy, and like this ends with the death of the hero.</p>

<p>He was torn away in the midst of his activity.
Through his enterprise a great continent was scientifically
explored, a vast Arctic coast, the longest in the world,
was charted, a new route to the western world was found,
and the way paved for Russian civilization beyond the
Pacific, while enormous sources of wealth&mdash;a Siberian
Eldorado&mdash;were opened on the Aleutian Islands for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
fur-hunter and adventurer. Russian authors have compared
Bering with Columbus and Cook. He certainly
was for Russia, the land of his adoption, what the two
former were for Spain and England&mdash;a great discoverer,
an honest, hardy, and indefatigable pioneer for knowledge,
science, and commerce. He led Europe's youngest
marine out upon explorations that will ever stand
in history as glorious pages, and as living testimony
of what Northern perseverance is able to accomplish
even with most humble means.</p>

<p>And yet he only partly succeeded in accomplishing
what for sixteen years had been the object of his endeavors.
His voyage to America was merely a reconnoitering
expedition, which, in the following summer,
was to have been repeated with better equipments.</p>

<p>Chirikoff, who on the expedition in 1741, about
simultaneously with Bering,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> discovered a more southerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>part of the North American coast, returned to Avacha
in such an impaired condition that, in 1742, he could
undertake no enterprise of importance.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> On account of
the great misfortunes that overwhelmed the expedition,
Laptjef was prevented from completing the charting of
Kamchatka. Thus we see that on every side of Bering's
grave lay unfinished tasks. These tasks were inherited
from the Dano-Russian explorer by his great successor
Cook, and other younger navigators. Moreover, his
death occurred at an extremely fatal period; for in these
same dark December days while Bering was struggling
with death in the sandpits of Bering Island, Biron,
M&uuml;nnich, and Ostermann lost their supremacy in St.
Petersburg. The Old Russian party, the opponents of
Peter the Great's efforts at reform, came into power,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>and during Elizabeth's inert administration, all modern
enterprises, the Northern Expedition among them, were
allowed to die a natural death. At Avacha and Okhotsk
affairs wore a sorrowful aspect. The forces of
the expedition had been decimated by sickness and death,
their supplies were nearly exhausted, their rigging and
sails destroyed by wind and weather, the vessels more
or less unseaworthy, and East Siberia drained and devastated
by famine; only Bering's great powers of perseverance
could have collected the vanishing forces for a
last endeavor. On September 23, 1743, an imperial
decree put an end to any further undertakings. Meanwhile,
the crew of the St. Peter had, in August, 1742,
returned to Avacha in a boat made from the timber of
the stranded vessel. Chirikoff had previously departed
for Okhotsk, to which place also Spangberg returned
from his third voyage to Japan. Gradually the forces
of the various expeditions gathered in Tomsk, where,
first under the supervision of Spangberg and Chirikoff,
and later that of Waxel and other officers, they remained
until 1745. Thus ended the Great Northern
Expedition.</p>

<p>But Bering's ill fate pursued him even after death.
During the reign of Empress Elizabeth, nothing was
done to make known the results of these great and
expensive explorations, nor to establish the reputation of
the discoverers. The reports of Bering and his co-workers,
which make whole cartloads of manuscript,
were buried in the archives of the Admiralty. Only
now and then did a meager, and usually incorrect, account
come to the knowledge of the world. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
geographers of that day insisted that the Russian government
system of suppression merely aimed at excluding
the rest of Europe from that profitable maritime
trade through the Arctic seas for which the Northern
Expedition had opened the way. Ignorance on this subject
was so great that Joseph de l'Isle ventured even
before the French Academy to refer to himself as the
originator of the expedition,&mdash;to rob Bering of his dearly
bought honor, and to proclaim to the world that Bering
accomplished no more on this expedition than his own
shipwreck and death. With Buache he published a book
and a map to prove his statements. The name De l'Isle
at that time carried with it such weight that he might
have succeeded in deceiving the world for a time, if G.
F. M&uuml;ller had not, in an anonymous pamphlet written in
French, disproved these falsehoods. But even M&uuml;ller's
sketch in <i>Sammlung Russischer Geschichte</i> (1758), the
first connected account published concerning these expeditions,
has great defects, as we have seen, not only from
the standpoint of historical accuracy, but it also shows a
lack of appreciation of the geographical results obtained
by Bering. Hence it would have been impossible for
Cook to render the discoverer long-deferred justice, if he
had not known D'Anville's map and Dr. Campbell's essay.
Thus it was West Europe that last century rescued
Bering's name from oblivion. In our day the Russian
Admiralty has had this vast archival material examined
and partly published, but much must yet be done before
a detailed account can be given of the enterprises we have
attempted to sketch, or of the man who was the soul of
them all. We hardly feel disposed, with Professor Von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Baer, to urge the erection of a monument in St. Petersburg,
as a restitution for long forgetfulness, former misjudgment,
and lack of appreciation. As Russia's first
navigator and first great discoverer, he certainly has merited
such a distinction. We shall, however, consider our
task accomplished, if we have succeeded in giving in
these pages a reliable account of the life and character of
a man who deserves to be remembered, not only by that
nation which must ever count Vitus Bering among her
good and faithful sons, but also by the country that harvested
the fruits of his labors.</p>

and corrections of scientific interest, says: "The mountains which Steller
and his companions saw were not eruptive rocks. The whole island consists
of a more or less coarsely grained sandstone or conglomerate,&mdash;Plutonic
rock cropping out only in isolated spots. The mountain streams of
Bering island are anything but 'seething'; on the contrary, they are as a
rule very quiet."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_87_87" id="Footnote_87_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> Dr. Stejneger, ever on the alert to honor Steller, says in <i>Deutsche Geographische
Bl&auml;tter</i>, 1885: "It was due to Steller that not only a majority of
the participants survived, but that the expedition won a lasting name in
the history of science. Bering left his name to the island upon which he
died, and the group to which it belongs. Komandorski (Commander Islands),
was named after his rank. Moreover, Bering Sea, Bering Strait, a peninsula
in Asia, and a bay in America have been named in honor of him. But what
is there in these regions to remind one of the immortal Steller, the Herodotus
of these distant lands? Search the map of the island of which he has
given such a spirited description. His name is nowhere to be found, while
three capes have received the names of Bering's lieutenants and helmsmen,
who were the authors of the whole misfortune: Waxel, Khitroff, and Jushin.
The man that rescued and immortalized the expedition has fallen into
oblivion. I consider it an honor that it has been granted to me to render
long deferred justice to this great German investigator. The highest mountain
peak on Bering's Island will henceforth be called Mount Steller."
</p>
<p>
In speaking of a description by Steller of some rock formations on the
western coast that resembled ancient ruins, Dr. S. says in the same article:
"I landed at the only remaining one of these arches, under which Steller
had probably walked. It is a fine specimen of a natural triumphal arch,
standing quite by itself. In honor of Steller I called it Steller's Triumphal
Arch. No monument marks his resting-place on the desert steppes of Siberia;
Russia has never forgiven him for his ingenuous criticism of the injustice
of her courts; but Steller's name will nevertheless live. His Triumphal
Arch, gaily decked with the variegated lichens <i>Caloplaca murorum</i> and
<i>crenulata</i>, and adorned with the lovely white golden-eyed blossoms of the
<i>Chrysanthemum arcticum</i>, is a monument that does fitting honor to the great
naturalist."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tr.</span></p></div>

of this question: "It may thus be regarded as fairly proved that the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_91_91" id="Footnote_91_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_91"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> These pits or earth huts lay in a direction from north to south. Next
to Steller's hut was the miserable pit in which Vitus Bering, a hundred
and forty-eight years ago, drew his last breath. August 30, 1882, Dr. Stejneger
visited this place, of which he gives the following description in
<i>Deutsche Geographische Bl&auml;tter</i>, 1885, pp. 265-6: "I was first attracted to the
ruins of the huts in which the shipwrecked crew passed a winter a hundred
and forty-one years previous. On a projecting edge of the western
slope of the mountain, in the northern corner of the valley, stands a large
Greek cross. Tradition says that Bering was buried there. The present
cross is of recent date. The old one, erected by the Russian company,
was shattered by a storm, but the stump may still be seen. No one thought
of erecting a new one, until Hr. von Grebnitski attended to the matter.
Directly southeast of the cross, close to the edge of a steep declivity,
about twenty feet high, lie the fairly well preserved ruins of the house.
The walls are of peat, about three feet high and three feet thick. They
were covered with a very luxuriant growth of grass, and, moreover, swarms
of mosquitoes helped make investigation very unpleasant work. * * *
The floor was covered with a thick turf, the removal of which was out of
the question. I probed the whole surface with a bayonet, but nothing of
significance was found. * * * A part of the crew were undoubtedly
lodged in the sandpits under the barrow, of which Steller speaks. And in
fact traces of the pits still exist, although they no longer have any definite
form, being, moreover, so overgrown with vegetation that nothing
could be ascertained from them. Some Arctic foxes had burrowed there.
At our approach the whole brood came out, and in close proximity stood
curiously gazing at us. Steller and his companions are gone, but the
Arctic fox, which played them so many tricks, is still there. The pits,
now merely an irregular heap of sand filled with burrows, lie close to the
brook, where it curves sharply toward the west, cutting into the declivity
on which the house stands."&mdash;<i>Author's Note to American Edition.</i></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_93_93" id="Footnote_93_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_93_93"><span class="label">[93]</span></a> Bancroft, who, strange to say, calls Chirikoff "the hero of this expedition,"
gives a detailed account of the voyage of the St. Paul after its separation
from the St. Peter. Lauridsen does not do this, for the obvious reason
that he considers Chirikoff's expedition of but comparatively little importance,
although he doubtless would be willing to second Bancroft's estimate
of Chirikoff as a man "who, amongst Russians, was the noblest and most
chivalrous of them all." There seems to be no reason to doubt that
Chirikoff sighted the coast of Northwest America about thirty-six hours
before Bering did. On the 11th of July signs of land were seen, and on the
15th land was sighted in latitude 55&deg; 21', according to Bancroft, who, at this
point in his narrative, exclaims: "Thus was the great discovery achieved."
Chirikoff's return voyage was fraught with hardships and suffering. Before
the expedition reached Avacha Bay, October 8, twenty-one were lost. The
pilot Yelagin alone of all the officers could appear on deck, and he finally
brought the ship into the harbor of Petropavlovsk. Croy&egrave;re, the astronomer,
died as soon as he was exposed to the air on deck. Chirikoff, very ill, was
landed the same day. Eventful as the expedition in some respects was, it
nevertheless possesses no particular geographical or scientific interest, for
there is great doubt even as to where landings were made and what islands
were seen. Bancroft speaks very cautiously on these points. Sokoloff, however,
declares emphatically that the land first discovered by Chirikoff was a
slight projection of the coast between Capes Addington and Bartholomew of
Vancouver's map. Moreover, the lands in these regions received no names
from the St. Paul, whereas the St. Peter forged, along the islands of the
North Pacific, a chain of names, many of which are still the permanent possession
of geography. When it is furthermore remembered that Chirikoff
was one of Bering's assistants, that the fitting out of the expedition was
under the charge of Bering, and that upon him rested all responsibility to the
government, it is certainly impossible for any fair minded person to accept
the statement that Chirikoff "must ever be regarded as the hero of this
expedition." Bancroft does not, however, approve of Sokoloff's vainglorious
expressions concerning "the achievements of Chirikoff, a true Russian,
as against Bering the Dane." Principally in the one fact of a few
hours' priority of discovery, Solokoff finds proof of "the superiority of the
Russians in scientific navigation!" Bancroft occasionally reminds the
reader that "Russian historians are perhaps a little inclined to magnify the
faults of Bering the Dane," and in this instance administers to Sokoloff the
following reproof: "So the learner is often apt to grow bold and impudent
and despise the teacher. The great Peter was not above learning navigation
from Bering the Dane." In speaking of Bering's death, Bancroft further
retrieves himself&mdash;indeed, seems quite to supersede his former opinion&mdash;by
saying: "Thus passed from earth, as nameless tens of thousands have
done, the illustrious commander of the expeditions which had disclosed the
separation of the two worlds and discovered north-westernmost America."

<p class="ph2">APPENDIX.</p>

<p class="ph3">BERING'S REPORT TO THE ADMIRALTY FROM OKHOTSK,
DEC. 5, 1737.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>


<p>From the instructions forwarded to me by His
Imperial Highness, I learn that the Imperial College
of Admiralty is inclined to the opinion that the
expedition is lingering along idly on account of my
heedlessness. This arouses in me no little anxiety
for fear that I may incur undeserved wrath; yet in this
matter I await the will of his Imperial Highness and
the most gracious resolution of the Imperial College.
For although, from the time the expedition was put
in my charge until the present time, I have faithfully
and diligently sought as quickly as possible to build
vessels, put out to sea, and begin the execution of
my work proper, everything has suffered delay on
account of unexpected obstacles over which I have
had no control. Prior to our arrival in Yakutsk, not
a single pood of provisions had been sent to Okhotsk
for the crew there, not a single vessel had been built
for transporting these provisions and supplies, and
not a single magazine had been built at the stopping
places on the Maya and Yudoma rivers. No laborers
were to be had, and no arrangements whatsoever had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>been made by the Siberian government officials, notwithstanding
the fact that an imperial ukase had
ordered these things. We have done all this. We
built transports, demanded laborers from Yakutsk, and
with great difficulty brought our provisions in these
transports to Yudomskaya Krest,&mdash;yes, with superhuman
efforts our command and these laborers&mdash;since
even upon my demand but very few were sent&mdash;also
brought the supplies at Yudomskaya Krest (12,000
poods of flour and rice) to Okhotsk. Moreover, at the
stopping place on the Maya, at the mouth of the
Yudoma, at the Cross, and on the Urak, we erected
magazines and dwellings for the forces, and also built
four winter-huts between Yudomskaya Krest and Urak
as places of refuge during the winter. Furthermore,
in accordance with our plans, we built, in 1736, at
the stopping place on the Urak, fifteen, and during
this year, 1737, sixty-five vessels on which to float
the provisions down the Urak. Of these, forty-two
are still at the place of construction, the remaining
thirty-seven having departed with provisions in 1735.
All of this has been done under my orders, not by
the government officials of Siberia.</p>

<p>In Yakutsk, where I was at that time staying, we
built two vessels, the boat Irkutsk and the sloop
Yakutsk, and in 1735 sent them out on the expeditions
assigned to them. We took pains to provision
them well, and furthermore sent four barges to the
mouth of the Lena with additional provisions for
them. In 1736 the Yakutsk had the misfortune to
lose its chief, Lieut. Lassenius, and many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
crew. Others were hopelessly ill, and hence, as I
feared that the work assigned to this expedition would
not be accomplished, I was obliged to man the vessel
anew from Yakutsk. The sick were taken to Yakutsk
to be nursed. I did all that was possible for them,
and by the help of God they were saved. For these
same two ships I sent, in 1736, from the provisions
of my command, two lighters with provisions, and
during the present year, 1737, I have likewise sent a
boat to the mouth of the Lena, as the provisions sent
in 1735 were nearly exhausted. But from the voivode
in Yakutsk we received no support whatever. From
this it is evident that my stay in Yakutsk was necessarily
prolonged. Nor was it possible for me to go to
Okhotsk with my men until I had sent some provisions
ahead. Otherwise I should have taken the risk
of starving them to death, putting an end to all
hopes of accomplishing anything, and thus incurring
a heavy responsibility. Some of my men remained
in Yakutsk in charge of the affairs of the expedition
there, and to forward provisions. Others remained at
the Maya harbor, Yudomskaya Krest, and at the Urak
landing, to guard the magazines and attend to the
transportation of necessaries to Okhotsk, for it is not
yet possible to feed so many at Okhotsk. The fact
that the voivode in Yakutsk made such long delay
in appointing commissioners to receive and send me
supplies, prevented me from keeping my men together
and availing myself of their assistance. As early as
June 2, 1735, I demanded the appointment of three
commissioners and such assistants as I thought necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to be stationed along the route. The authorities
at Yakutsk did not comply until the present year,
1737, and then only after repeated demands on my
part. But if I had neglected to attend to these matters,
and had hastened the departure to Okhotsk, the
voivode&mdash;in my absence&mdash;would have done nothing,
and it remains to be seen how the transportation to
Yudomskaya Krest will be attended to. * * * As
the difficulties with which we have had to contend are
very obvious, and although as a consequence the immediate
starting out of the expedition is improbable, I
can, nevertheless, conscientiously say that I do not
see how I could have in a greater degree hastened the
work of the expedition, or how I could have intensified
the zeal with which I have worked from the very
beginning. Through this report I therefore most humbly
seek at the hands of the Admiralty a considerate
judgment, and hope that it will show that matters
have not been delayed through my carelessness.</p>

<p>It is on account of these obstacles, together with
the fact that there was much work to be done in
Okhotsk, that I have been unable to prepare, in a
short time, the ships necessary for the voyage. My
command has had to work at Spangberg's ships, which
are now ready. But also in Okhotsk, on the "Cat"
(Koschka), where these vessels and packet-boats are
being built, everything was bare and desolate. There
was not a building there,&mdash;nowhere to stay. Trees
and grass do not grow there, and are not found in
the vicinity on account of the gravel. In spite of
the fact that the region is so barren, it is nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
very well suited for ship-building. It is a good place for
launching, for starting out, and as a harbor of refuge
for these ships. There is, in fact, no better place on
this coast. Hence, according to Spangberg's directions,
a house was built on the "Cat" for the officers,
and barracks and huts for the men. For these buildings
our men hauled the clay, made the tiles, brought
wood from a distance of three to four miles, and carried
fresh water from a distance of about two miles;
for although the Koschka is situated at the mouth of
the Okhota, the water in the river is very salty on
account of the tide-water. Moreover, we have built
storehouses and a powder magazine. I enclose three
diagrams, showing what has been done in the years
1735, 1736, and 1737. My men in Okhotsk are now
preparing ship-biscuits for the voyages, and are floating
the necessary timber for the boats twenty miles down
the river. They burn the charcoal used in forging, and
the necessary pitch must be prepared and brought from
Kamchatka, as there is no pitch-pine in the vicinity
of Okhotsk.</p>

<p>In addition to this we are obliged to make our own
dog-sledges, and on these bring our provisions from
Yudomskaya Krest to the Urak landing. There is,
too, much other work in Okhotsk that must be done in
preference to ship-building, for it is quite impossible
to get anything in the way of food except the legal
military provisions, consisting of flour and groats. I
must state, in this connection, that in the summer some
cattle are sent with the transports from Yakutsk.
These are obtained at the regular price and are distributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
among the crews; but on account of the
great distance, and the reluctance of the Yakuts to
sell to others than the yassak collectors, except when
in great need, the supply has been limited.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the authorities at Okhotsk
were directed to prepare fish for the expedition, I
found that nothing whatever had been done in this
regard; but, on the contrary, they monopolized the supplies
of the Tunguses, who furnished my first expedition
with an abundance of fish, and upon whom I had depended.
For this reason we are forced to give the men
leave of absence in the summer, so that they may obtain
food by fishing, thus causing a loss of time and neglect
of the work of the expedition. Our force might be
divided into different parties, for ship-building, fishing,
and miscellaneous work, but we have not found it expedient
to do this. Especially on account of the fact that
many have been assigned to the work of transportation,
there are not as many engaged in ship-building as necessary,
or as was ordered by the Imperial College of Admiralty.
Lack of sufficient provisions has prevented this.
Here in Okhotsk we have but a small number of laborers.
The rest, for whom there will be no provisions until in the
spring, we have sent to Yudomskaya Krest to bring provisions
and other necessary supplies on dog-sledges to the
Urak landing, and to construct at this place twenty new
barges for use in the spring of 1738. New barges must be
built every year, for those that are floated down the Urak
can not be returned on account of the swiftness of the
current. They are, however, used for other purposes in
Okhotsk. It takes four men ten days to build a barge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and four or five to man one. I most respectfully ask the
Imperial College of Admiralty to consider the number of
men employed at this work, and what they are accomplishing.
All of this, too, is being done by my forces.
From the government officer in Okhotsk, Skornjakoff-Pissarjeff,
we have not, since the day of our arrival here
up to the present time, received the slightest assistance
in transportation, ship-building, or anything else whatsoever.
Nor have we any hope of obtaining any such
assistance in the future. And even if we should demand
support from him, we would only have long and fruitless
negotiations with him, for while in Yakutsk, he sent me
a written notification (February 28, 1737), refusing to
assist in the transportation from Yudomskaya Krest to
Okhotsk.</p>

<p>In addition to the facts here adduced, together with
my earlier reports to the Imperial College of Admiralty,
wherein I have given an account of my efforts for the
progress of the enterprise and shown the impossibility of
an early consummation of the main object of my expedition,
I appeal to the testimony of all the officers of my
command. All of which is respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>As Berch hints that Bering had many enemies in the Department
of the Marine, I have made inquiries on this point. Admiral
Th. Wessalgo informs me that Berch's account is entirely without
foundation. Bering demanded and got his discharge in 1724,
because he was dissatisfied with the regulations governing promotions.</p>

<p>The name Anian Strait has arisen through a misunderstanding of
Marco Polo's book (lib. III., cap. 5). His Ania is no doubt the
present Anam, but the Dutch cartographers thought that this land
was in Northeast Asia, and called the strait that was said to separate
the continents the Strait of Anian. The name appears for the first
time on Gerh. Mercator's famous maritime chart of 1569.</p>

<p>Concerning Bering's determinations of longitude and latitude, O.
Peschel says: "<i>Auf der ganzen Erde gibt es vielleicht keine wichtigere
Ortsbestimmung, als die von Petropaulovski, insofern von ihr
die mathematischen L&auml;ngen in der Beringsstrasse abh&auml;ngen, welche
die Erdveste in zwei grosse Inseln trennt. Mit lebhafter Freude
gewahrt man, dass schon der Entdecker Bering auf seiner ersten
Fahrt trotz der Unvollkommenheit seiner Instrumente die L&auml;ngen
von Okhotsk, die S&uuml;dspitze Kamchatkas und die Ostspitze Asiens,
bis auf Bruchtheile eines Grades richtig bestimmte."&mdash;Geschichte
der Erdkunde</i>, pp. 655-56.</p>

<p>A list of Bering's determinations is found in Harris's Collection
of Voyages, II., 1021, London, 1748.</p>

<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century there was a violent
attack on Bering's determinations. Samuel Engel, Vaugondie, and
Bushing tried to show that according to these Asia had been put too
far east. S. Engel: <i>Remarques sur la partie de la relation du voyage
du Capt. Cook qui concerne le d&eacute;troit entre l'Asie et l'Am&eacute;rique</i>.
Berne, 1781.&mdash;M. D. Vaugondie: <i>M&eacute;moire sur les pays de l'Asie</i>,
etc., Paris, 1774.&mdash;Bushing's Magazine, VIII., IX.</p>

<p>14. Cook and King: Voyage to the Pacific Ocean, III., 473: "In
justice to the memory of Bering, I must say that he has delineated
the coast very well, and fixed the latitude and longitude of the
points better than could be expected from the methods he had to go
by. This judgment is not formed from Mr. M&uuml;ller's account of the
voyage or the chart prefixed to his book, but from Dr. Campbell's
account of it in his edition of Harris's Collection and a map thereto
annexed, which is both more circumstantial and accurate than that
of Mr. M&uuml;ller." The chart which Cook refers to is a copy of
Bering's own chart as given by D'Anville.</p>

<p>Concerning East Cape, Cook says: "I must conclude, as Bering
did before me, that this is the most eastern point of Asia," p. 470.</p>

<p>16. See Steller's various works, especially the introduction to the
one on Kamchatka, where it is stated that Bering returned "<i>ohne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
doch das geringste entdeckt zu haben</i>." This introduction was
written by J. B. S. (Scherer).</p>

<p>16. In Petermann's <i>Mittheilungen</i>, 1879, p. 163, Dr. Lindemann
says that Bering turned back "without having seen, strange to say,
either the Diomedes or the American coast." The author's authority
is evidently W. H. Dall, an extremely unfortunate historian. The
latter says: "Bering, naturally timid, hesitating, and indolent,
determined to go no farther for fear of being frozen in, and returned
through the Strait&mdash;strange to say&mdash;without seeing the Diomedes or
the American coast." See Dall: Alaska and its Resources. Boston,
1870, p. 297.</p>

be considered an echo of M&uuml;ller.</p>

<p>24. See M&uuml;ller's own review of the Russians' early knowledge of
the peninsula in Vol. III. of <i>Sammlung Russ. Geschichte</i>. Even as

expedition hostilities were still smoldering.&mdash;East Cape is 600 miles
from Anadyrskoi Ostrog.</p>

<p>26. J. D. Cochrane has, in Narrative of a Pedestrian Journey,
London, 1825, App. p. 299, attempted to establish Pavlutski's route,
unsuccessfully, however, we think. On the whole, accounts and
opinions concerning Pavlutski are so uncertain, that it is impossible
by means of the literature on this point, to give a final opinion. See
Fr. L&uuml;tke: <i>Voyage autour du monde</i>, II., 238. "<i>Sauer dit que Pavlovtsky

with the original Chukchee name, <i>Linglingay</i>.</p>

<p>28. Steller: <i>Beschreibung von dem Lande Kamtschatka</i>, p. 15.
Steller sways back and forth between M&uuml;ller's views and the
account that he himself obtained of the real state of affairs. He
met M&uuml;ller in West Siberia in 1739, when the latter was filled
with his supposed epoch-making discoveries in Yakutsk archives.
In <i>Reise nach Amerika</i>, p. 6, Steller says: "<i>So verblieb es nichts
desto weniger auf Seiten der damals gebrauchten Officiere bey einer
kurzen Untersuchung des Landes Kamtschatka, von Lopatka bis zu
dem sogenannten Serze Kamen, welche bey weitem das Tschuktschiske
Vorgebirge noch nicht ist.</i>" He has so little knowledge of
Bering's work that he can immediately go on to say: "<i>Gwosdew ist
viel weiter und bis 66 Grad Norderbreite gekommen</i>."</p>

<p>29. How varying the views on this subject have been even in
the narrowest academical circles may be seen from the following:
In a German edition of <i>Atlas Russicus</i>, 1745, Serdze Kamen
appears as a mountain in the center of the Chukchee peninsula.
(By Calque, placed at my disposal by A. Thornam, of St. Petersburg.
In the French edition the name is not found at all.) On the
maps which accompany J. E. Fischer's <i>Sibirische Geschichte</i>, 1768,
and Ginelin's work, Serze Kamen and Kammenoie Serdze are found,
but in different places of Bering Strait, both different from M&uuml;ller's.</p>

<p>30. Cook and King: Voyage, etc., I., 469: "Thus far Bering
proceeded in 1728, that is, to this head, which M&uuml;ller says is called
Serdze Kamen on account of a rock upon it shaped like a heart.
But I conceive that Mr. M&uuml;ller's knowledge of these parts is very
imperfect. There are many elevated rocks upon this cape, and possibly
some one or other of them may have the shape of a heart.</p>

<p>"At four in the morning the cape, which, on the authority of
M&uuml;ller, we have called Serdze Kamen, bore S. S. West." III., 261.</p>

<p>32. <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Kenntniss, etc.</i>, XVI., 44. Note.</p>

<p>33. Philip Johann Tabbert, ennobled in 1707 and called Von
Strahlenberg, was born at Stralsund in 1676, and taken captive
after the battle of Pultowa as captain in the army of Charles XII.
He was banished to Tobolsk, traveled some years with Dr. Messerschmidt
in Siberia, and together with other Swedish officers he
made several maps of Siberia, which, without his knowledge or consent,
were published in Holland by Bentinck, 1726, in <i>L'Histoire des
Tartares</i>, etc., and reprinted in various works such as <i>La Russie
asiatique, tir&eacute;e de la Carte donn&eacute;e par ordre du feu Czar</i>. In
1730, Strahlenberg's own work appeared in Leipsic; it is marked by
its minute knowledge of details. His representation of the Chukchees
peninsula deserves attention as evidence of the knowledge the
Cossacks had of this region, whereas there is nothing original in his
representation of the coast-lines of Eastern Asia. Baer says that
Strahlenberg's book and map was made by a Leipsic student, and
that whatever it contains that is of value is taken from Messerschmidt.

<p>34. This map is reproduced in Nordenskj&ouml;ld's Voyage of the
Vega.</p>

erroneous and unreasonable account of the result of Bering's first
expedition is given.</p>

et Specialis</i>, Vol. XLIII.</p>

<p>37. Strangely enough, no original copy seems to have remained
in the archives of the Admiralty. Berch insists that no such copy
exists. I investigated the matter in 1883, and later Mr. A. Thornam
has examined the archives for this purpose, but without result.</p>

<p>38. Du Halde writes: <i>Ce Capitaine revint &aacute; Sct. Petersburg le
premier jour de Mars de l'ann&eacute;e 1730, et apporta une relation succinte
de son voyage, avec la Carte qu'il en avoit dress&eacute;e. Cette

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Swedish geographical journal, "Ymer," 1884, there is an
interesting account by E. W. Dahlgren of the copies of Bering's
chart in Sweden.</p>

<p>39. Gmelin: <i>Reise durch Sibirien</i>. Introduction.</p>

<p>40. Bering's proposition was formulated as follows: (1) As the
waves, according to my observation, are smaller east of Kamchatka
[than in the open ocean], and, moreover, as I have on Karaginski
Island found large fir-trees washed ashore, which do not grow in
Kamchatka, it is my opinion that America or some intervening land
can not be very far from Kamchatka (150-200 geographical miles).
In case this is so, commercial relations with that country that would
be to the advantage of the Russian empire could be established.
This matter can be investigated, if a vessel is built of from 45 to 50
tons burden. (2) This vessel ought to be built at Kamchatka, as at
this place more available timber is found than at other places [on
the east coast]; moreover, provisions for the crew, fish and other
animals are easily obtained. Besides, greater assistance can be
obtained from the Kamchadales than from the inhabitants of
Okhotsk. (3) It would not be without advantage to find out the sea-route
from Okhotsk or Kamchatka to the mouth of the Amoor and
farther on to the Japan Islands, as we there have hopes of finding
inhabited regions. It would be well to establish commercial relations
with them, especially with the Japanese, which promises the
Russian empire no small advantage in the future. For this purpose
a ship of the same size or a little smaller than the first might be
built. (4) The expenses of this expedition in addition to the salaries
and the materials, which could not be secured there, but would have
to be taken along from here or Siberia, would, including the transport,
amount to ten or twelve thousand rubles. (5) If it is considered
advisable to chart the northern coast of Siberia, especially from
the mouth of the Obi to the Yenisei and hence to the Lena, this can
be done by sailing down these rivers or by expeditions by land, as
these regions are under Russian rule.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Vitus Bering.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1em;">April 30, 1730.</p>

<p>These propositions were first published by Berch in "The First
Russian Admirals," and later reprinted by Sokoloff in <i>Zapiski
Hydrograficheskago Departamenta</i> (Journal of Hydr. Dept.), St.
Petersburg, IX., Appendix.</p>

1849.&mdash;Bering's wife was suspected of having acquired goods illegally,
but there is no proof of this. When she, in the year 1738,
returned from Siberia, the Senate, influenced by the numerous
denunciations of her conduct, issued an ukase that her goods should
be examined. At the inspection on the borders of Siberia it was
found that she had a suspiciously large quantity of furs and other
things. She rather overawed the authorities, however, and returned
to St. Petersburg unmolested. Sokoloff gives no information as to
whether the furs were illegally obtained or not. She was very much
younger than Bering; in 1744, on making application for a widow's
pension, she gave her age as 39 years.</p>

<p>Your expedition is a very protracted one, and apparently it is
being conducted somewhat carelessly on your part, which is shown
by the fact that it has taken nearly two years to reach Yakutsk.
Moreover, it appears from your report that your stay in Yakutsk will
be too long; in fact, there seems to be no reason to hope that you
will succeed in getting any farther. As a consequence of all this
the Admiralty is extremely dissatisfied with your arrangements, and
will not let matters go on without an investigation. If in the future
any negligence whatever occurs, an investigation will be instituted
against you for insubordination to the decrees of His Imperial
Highness and for negligence in an affair of state.</p></div>

<p>Inasmuch as you&mdash;in spite of the express orders of the Admiralty,
wherein it is stated that your expedition is protracted and is carelessly
conducted&mdash;have not reported to the Admiralty the cause of
your delay, and say nothing about when you intend to leave

<p>From Captain Chirikoff there has been received by the Admiralty
a report from Okhotsk with an accompanying copy of a proposition
laid before you by Chirikoff, suggesting measures for a more speedy
completion of the Kamchatka expedition under your charge. As no
steps had been taken by you in this direction as late as May 8 of the
same year, the Admiralty has concluded to demand an answer from
you, if any plans have been made on the basis of Chirikoff's proposition,
and if, contrary to our expectations, nothing has been done,
we desire to know <i>why</i>,&mdash;since, according to the orders issued to you
Feb. 21, 1737, you were instructed to show zeal and solicitude for
the activity of the expedition, and that any neglect on your part
would make you liable to the same punishment as that suffered by
Lieutenants Muravjeff and Pauloff for negligence in conducting
expeditions entrusted to them.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>45. To an inquiry directed to the Russian Admiralty asking the
reason for Bering's long stay in Yakutsk, Admiral Th. Wessalgo
has given me the following information:</p>

<p>"In Yakutsk, which was the base of operations for the whole
expedition, Bering was to secure wood, iron, and other materials for
the building of the necessary ships, and, what is most important, he
was to secure provisions, of which a yearly supply of 16,000 poods
was necessary. Although the furnishing of provisions had been
assigned to the Siberian authorities, they did nothing, in spite of
urgent and repeated demands; hence Bering had to undertake this
work himself. Moreover, the immense amount of materials and
provisions collected here was to be sent to Okhotsk, a task which
presented insurmountable obstacles: the country was a wild and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>desolate region, the local authorities refused their co-operation in
promoting the enterprise, there was constant contention and disagreement
among the various officers in charge, who were more concerned
in their own personal interests than in the common weal, and
Bering himself&mdash;was a weak character."</p>

<p>47. On account of the Chukchee war, D. Laptjef was to go
from Kolyma to Anadyr and from there send word to Bering for a
vessel or to go himself to Kamchatka for it,&mdash;in either case he was
to sail around the northeast point of Asia, and reach the mouth of
the Kolyma. When he, in 1741, arrived at Anadyr, Bering had
departed for America, and hence he could do no more than build
some boats, by means of which he, in 1742, charted the lower course
of the Anadyr, and returned in 1743 to Yakutsk. <i>Zapiski</i>, etc.: IX.,

<p>48. Baer says: <i>Es h&auml;tte dieser Expedition auch die volle Anerkennung
nicht fehlen k&ouml;nnen, die man ihnen jetzt erst zollen muss,
nachdem die verwandte Nordk&uuml;ste von Amerika nach vielfachen
Versuchen noch immer nicht ganz bekannt worden ist. Auch h&auml;tten

Schmidt expresses himself in the following manner concerning
Nordenskj&ouml;ld's presentation of the history of the Northeast passage:
<i>Die dritte Gruppe bilden endlich die russischen Reisen im Eismeer
und an den K&uuml;sten desselben, die ebenfalls ausf&uuml;hrlich behandelt
werden. Hier f&auml;llt es uns nun auf, dass im Bestreben, jedem das
Seine zukommen zu lassen, die weniger bekannten Mitarbeiter an der
Erweiterung unsrer Kenntniss, denen wir gewiss ihre Verdienste
nicht absprechen wollen, fast m&ouml;chte ich sagen auf Kosten unsrer
ber&uuml;hmten gelehrten Forscher hervorgezogen scheinen, von denen
namentlich Wrangell und auch Baer an mehreren Stellen Angriffe
zu erdulden haben, die wir nicht f&uuml;r gerechtfertigt halten k&ouml;nnen.
Auch L&uuml;tke * * * kommt sehr kurz weg.</i></p>

<p>This criticism might be applied to other parts of Nordenskj&ouml;ld's
historical writings.</p>

(which in D'Anville's Atlas are placed in the track we had just
crossed) being, by this means, demonstratively removed from that
situation, an additional proof is obtained of their lying to the westward,
where Spangberg actually places them, between the long. 142&deg;
and 147&deg;. But as this space is occupied, in the French charts, by
that part of the supposed Land of Jeso and Staten Island, Mr.
M&uuml;ller's opinion becomes extremely probable that they are all the
same lands; and, as no reasons appear for doubting Spangberg's
accuracy, we have ventured in our general map to reinstate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Three Sisters, Zellany and Kunashir, in their proper situation, and
have entirely omitted the rest."&mdash;Cf. O. Peschel's account, p. 467,

<p>55. The pre-Bering explorations of Northwest America did not
extend beyond the northern boundary of California, and had not
succeeded in ascertaining a correct outline of the country. In the
oldest maps of the new world, that of Ortelius (1570), Mercator
(1585), Ramusio (1606), and W. Blaew (1635), California is represented
as a peninsula; but on the maps of later cartographers
as W. Samson (1659), Wischer (1660), J. Blaew, Jansen (1662), Fr.
de Witt (1666), and Nic. Samson (1667), the country is represented
as an island, and this view was held until G. de L'Isle (1720)
adopted in his atlas the old cartography of the peninsula.</p>

<p>Gvosdjeff's expedition to Bering's Strait in 1732 is but slightly
and very imperfectly known in West Europe. It was undertaken
by Ivan Fedoroff, Moschkoff, who had accompanied Bering on his
first expedition, and the surveyor Gvosdjeff. Fedoroff is thus the
real discoverer of America from the east, and the world has given
Gvosdjeff the honor simply for the reason that the reports of
Fedoroff and his associate were lost and he himself died the year
after. There is an interesting account of this enterprise in <i>Zapiski</i>,
etc., IX., 78.</p>

<p>59. According to Wrangell, Dall and others, both Indians and
Eskimos inhabit this region. Clans of the great Tinn&eacute; tribe,
Ugalenses, stay during the summer on the Atna River, and during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
the winter on Kayak Island; but on the coast of the continent from
Ice Bay to the Atna River there are also found Innuits, the Ugalakmuts.&mdash;See
Vahl: Alaska, p. 39. The people that Bering found on
the island must, according to Sauer, have been Chugachees, Eskimos
that live about Prince William's Sound.</p>

<p>64. Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, under date of June 9, 1889, writes
the translator: "The locality indicated in L&uuml;tke's map is correct.
It is consequently on the eastern side of the island. Steller's statement
that it was on the northern side is easily explained as follows:
The valley where he landed opens toward the northeast, and the
corresponding valley on the other side of the island runs southwest;
this side consequently became the southern side. At the time of the
shipwreck the magnetic deviation was much more easterly than it is
now, so that <i>by compass</i> the direction of the eastern coast was much
more E.-W. than at present. Throughout his description of
Bering Island, Steller says north and south, where we would say east
and west.</p>

<p>"My visit to this locality in 1882, I have described in detail in
<i>Deutsche Geographische Bl&auml;tter</i> (1885), where you will also find a
sketch map of it, as well as a plan of the house in which the survivors
wintered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Since I wrote my account, I have been able to consult Steller's
own description of the wintering, and I find that the house which I
have described and given the plan of, was the one they built in the
spring, after the freshet which drove them out of the dug-outs (<i>Gruben</i>)
on the bank of the creek, traces of which are still visible.
I also found a number of relics at a place which I took to be the
point where they rebuilt the vessel. In a letter Mr. Lauridsen suggested
to me the probability that I had found not this place, but the
locality where the store-house was built, in which the men left what
they could not carry on the new vessel, and that the latter must
have been built near the southern end of the bay. After reading
Steller's own account, however, I feel absolutely certain that the
ship was built at the northern end, near the huts and dug-outs, at the
place where I found the relics. It is quite probable, however, that
the store-house was built in very close proximity, if not on the very
spot."</p>
